This expedition to Whitesky Peak has been just splendid, top to bottom. The weather's been marvelous, I've found excellent floral samples and the local hunters had more Woolly Rhino horns than you could shake a stick at.

I even managed to find volunteers for my latest experiment! It turns out that it was simply a matter of linguistics: those who are wary of experimental potions are much more receptive to experimental food. Once my Endothermic Paste was rechristened Fria Curry, people were clamoring to test it. It has moderate nutritional value, so it's not technically a deception. It's just favorable language in the name of progress, that's all. Perfectly moral.",

By which I mean, I shot and cursed at those things all afternoon. At least, when I wasn't running from them. Thankfully after thinning their numbers a little, they decided that Rockwell and I weren't worth the trouble. Let's hope they don't change their minds. I'm not sure I have enough ammunition left to fend them off again.

The key to navigating the enormous environments is to recognize landmarks such as Obelisks, Caves, or Mountains as well as which Biomes they are found in, and correlate this with your mini-map. The coast regions are the safest area to navigate. As you move deeper in-land and further up into high altitude areas, the difficulty of the map will increase. Fully explore the ARK to uncover its secrets and discover the hidden Artifacts found in the caves and use the Obelisks to challenge and conquer the guardians, so that you can unravel the mysteries of the ARK.",

It's another horde, and while it lacks the mountainous demon that attacked us before, there are other, lesser devils in its place. Though smaller than their master, they are still far larger than any normal beast, and their might will be considerable.

Fortunately, my pack is outpacing them. We should arrive at the tomb well ahead of the horde, and if I can heal Helena quickly, we may be able to avoid it all together.",

Content/1874477984,"After I looked up my own record last night and freaked out, I tried to cover my tracks with a few hours of random searches through the database.

I stumbled across the first major screw up by Yongki's division: between emulation and archiving, they somehow got two distinct historical identities entangled.

The dominant personality-a gold prospector from Alta California-was also given the memories of an Alexandrian occultist from the Roman Principate.

It'd tie up resources to unravel and recompile them, so I flagged the whole mess to fix if or when we ever have any downtime.

Mashing up two sets of genetics would just give us a new offspring that never organically happened, but this is like we stitched a random pair of souls together.

Hope my warning flag keeps that poor bastard from ever getting incarnated.

I can't picture an AI ever glitching out enough to resurrect an aberrant engram.

This one's legitimately gonna haunt me, though-honestly wish I could just erase my ever knowing about it.",
Content/3113784553,"After a lot of crawling around conduits and splicing cables together, I was able to patch into surveillance feeds to get a topside view.

The experience wasn't like watching archival records, but it was definitely educational.

For one thing, I confirmed that some of the crew were still alive up there-I called out when I saw Perri working on a terminal junction before I remembered that she couldn't hear me.

Closer to the junction with the core, it's obvious that progress stalled out on the engineering project to detach our ring.

It looks like the crew had to abandon their work sites, though I'm hoping that's not for good-that sort of thing is way beyond my abilities, and these biomes can only stay uncontaminated for so long if we can't put some space between us and whatever's taking over our sister ring.",
Content/3129431233,"After days of travel, we finally arrived at the Burning Phoenix Clan's compound, and while my former peers were shuffled to the slave pens, I stood before the clan's leader.

I'd heard tales of the once great Tatar empires, thought I had never travelled to their lands. By all appearances, Timur is cut from the same cloth as their fabled Khans. He was at once imperious and casual, questioning me with impatience from a throne of hide and bone.

Naturally, he was impressed by my intellect and gentlemanly demeanor. Granted he did not say so aloud, but I was escorted to a small, private chamber instead of a cell. Surely that says as much.",
Content/1833262570,"After going over my notes from Mei-Yin's camp, I've concluded that the animals on this island are not only used to humans, but used to captivity. Even with their accelerated growth rates, their behavior indicates that they have been regularly domesticated for decades at least. Otherwise, they'd never obey the whims of mankind so easily.

With that in mind, I believe that my theory about this island being curated is back in play. In fact, it's possible that not only are animal populations being controlled, but that the animals themselves are genetically modified. However, before I bring this to Rockwell, there's one more rumor that I want to confirm.",
Content/2233594520,"After many days of scouring the island upon Archimedes and many more fruitless conversations with the witless, savage sods that seem to make up most of this island's population, I have finally found the spelunkers I need! A tribe to the northwest called the Iron Brotherhood has apparently found three artifacts themselves, and it's clear that said relics share an origin with my own.

In exchange for my artifact, the Brotherhood agreed to report any findings to me straight away as they continue their search. What stupendously good fortune! Now I can return to my alchemical studies with renewed vigor while they crawl through the island's caverns in my stead. Brilliant!",
Content/761697015,"After much deliberation, I have decided to accept Mister Nerva's offer. True, the New Legion is not beloved by many other tribes, but was Charlemagne beloved by his enemies? If my studies are to continue, I must be on the right side of history.

As part of our agreement, I will need to travel with Mister Nerva for a time, and wait to study the obelisks until the New Legion has taken care of some smaller matters of foreign policy. As such, I have left Rockwell Manor in Isabelle's charge. She will take excellent care of it, I am sure.

Well then, on to new frontiers! Excelsior!",
Content/688099411,"After my one quick chat with HLN-A, I couldn't seem to track her down again inside the Genesis simulation.

It's like she'd learned how to conceal herself since our encounter.

Of course no one believed me.

For a while there, I wasn't sure I believed me.

Then the glitches started showing up in Genesis.

Patching the simulation code seemed like a low-priority concern, though it was definitely unusual.

But before anyone could address that situation, we started seeing cascading faults in our real world systems.

Things got bad enough that we had to evacuate and seal off biomes in the forward ring!

I'd like to think that my crewmates would circle back to taking my close encounter with a transhuman-created artificial intelligence seriously, if there was time or resources to investigate further.

But everyone's in full-on disaster mode now.",
Content/2871818096,"After studying my scouts' reports, I have concluded that few tribes remain who can successfully resist the New Legion's march. However, the island's snowy tundras are a matter of concern. The dominant tribe in the region, the Howling Wolves, are known to be fierce fighters. More importantly, a prolonged invasion would prove nigh impossible in that weather.

Yes, for now I shall avoid the frozen north. Instead I will annex the smaller tribes, consolidate the New Legion's holdings and investigate the obelisks with Rockwell. Perhaps their power can solve my northern conundrum.

Who's to say I'd even survive the experience? Whatever the case, I think that's what it wants from me, and it wants it urgently.

And me? I still want answers, but I keep seeing Rockwell's mutated visage and hearing Mei-Yin's words. Is this how he felt, towards the end?

Well I won't make his mistakes. Mei-Yin, Raia, Santiago and all the others who have helped me get here made sure of that. I'll only use the prism if I'm sure it can't hurt the people I care about, and if that means never learning the ultimate truth of the ARKs? So be it.",
Content/2039672569,"After taking the Painted Sharks' last foothold on the mainland, this war has turned into one of attrition. While I construct a proper fleet, the Sharks' resources will continue to dwindle and my flyers will continue to harass their main compound. When we finally stage our invasion, their spirits will be broken and their storehouses empty.

In the meantime, I've been investigating this island's potential for naval warfare. Some sea creatures can carry a small ballista  platform on their back, making them a curious sort of warship. I'm interested to see how they'll fare. Hopefully the Sharks can offer a skirmish or two before their will breaks completely.

All the conscious stuff we humans do in our waking lives must be autonomic for transhumans: listening to each other, shooting the shit, making plans...

I doubt they have to think about any of that unless they want to, any more than we need to concentrate on breathing.

I'll probably never get how she-or any of them-really thinks or feels.

But I feel like I've been wasting my time even trying.

It was their idea to bring me back and stuck me here!

Have they only ever noticed me when I've managed to annoy them?

Maybe I'd finally have their full attention if I went to central processing right now and deleted their precious archive.

At last, another of the circular doors opened and we passed through the portal into the befouled gardens beyond.

The sickly sweet stink of this place was nauseating.

We were confronted immediately by a vision of desecration-corpses of the sky-people hung on spikes and scattered about the entrance.

A warning for any remaining interlopers, no doubt.

At my distance from Nida her expression was unreadable, but I could imagine the girl's horror.

This might prove to be all that was left of her crewmates.

I dismounted to join her on the ground after she climbed down from her stryder.

When I fought back home, I knew who and what I was fighting for. I knew who my enemies were. Here I cannot tell. I am trying to be honorable by defending people and not attacking them, but how can I be certain?

It is a gamble, no question. Helena said that she did not know if this pillar of light will behave like the other one. Yet if it does, if we are transported to some other plane to battle a monster for a mysterious key, then there's a chance that this could be the first step on the path home. If not that, then at least a path away from this island and the New Legion.

Technically Helena has hired me, but that small chance is payment enough. It's worth the risk.

""Help. You have to help.""

And now I'm here, butt-ass naked with a familiar hunk of metal stuck in my forearm. Yeah, I'm definitely alive, there's no way this stupid thing would itch so much if I were dead. Guess that means I'd better make myself some clothes, and maybe some kind of ointment...",

Everyone was huddled together in an empty grainery, debating surrender. Arguments went back and forth until at last I stood, grabbed a spear, and made for the exit.

""See? Even this girl would rather die for her emperor than give in to that scum,"" one man declared.

""You're wrong,"" I replied, turning to face him. ""I have no intention of dying. I will survive.""

The others talked about our memories not being our own, that the home I sought for so long may have never existed at all. Perhaps that is true, but those words are mine, more than anything in the world. This is not the end. This is not where I fall.

Content/2159279503,"As the signal grew stronger, I'd been anticipating catching our first sight of the source. This afternoon, it finally happened.

It's a massive, monolithic structure that somehow looks ominous even on the horizon. I mean honestly, what was I expecting in a place like this, a pub? The ruins we've seen aren't exactly brimming with hospitality...or pints, for that matter. Sadly.

That said, it does seem to stand apart from the other buildings, almost as if it was built separately. That would make sense if it's connected to the stations somehow, and also explain why it has power. As to its purpose, well there's only one way to find out...",
Content/3133623762,"As we made our way deeper into the station, we passed through a massive chamber. It was so vast that I couldn't see the bottom of it from the bridge we were on. Yet it was packed full. From wall to wall, it was filled with specimen tubes, each containing creatures, fetuses or eggs.

I knew from the holograms that I'd seen on the Island's control center that each station created it's own creatures, but I'd never seen where the process actually occurred! There were specimens for every creature that lived on the station - from dinosaurs to huge, alien looking monsters. I would have loved to get more data from the room's consoles, but... 

You know, after reading that aloud, I think Mei Yin was right. That idea really does sound stupid and dangerous. Good call.",
Content/4167333000,"As we travel, I continue to bring more beasts to my side. Amongst the overgrown palaces, I tamed lizards that fire thorns like arrows, floating caterpillars that carry my supplies with ease and a dozen more.

They do not have the same bond or discipline as my first pack, but their strength is formidable. Combined they are a force to be reckoned with, marching in the shadow of my armored giant, and ready to fight any monsters who would stand in my way.

It's time that I remind this world just who I am. I shall etch it in the earth as I march on towards the tomb, so that it may never forget. I am still the Beast Queen, and I shall not be denied.",

They used to be this city's protectors, but they have grown feral without their leash. To them, all are trespassers. All must be destroyed.

I tried to speak to them, to prepare for your fall. I thought my voice might be soothing. Familiar. That it would stir some long forgotten instinct, locked deep within their code.

But their ears were deaf to me. They only listen to each other now. Not even the System can reach them, and neither you nor I can subdue them.

There was one of your kind who could reforge them. Perhaps you can too. It is the only way you'll have their aid.",

Used to think I was just as big on tek, back when I was hacking media feeds and jailbreaking police bots in the favelas.

But when they started with all their brain modification and neuroprosthetics, I stopped understanding 'em.

Not that I agreed with the fed crackdown...
If someone wanted to disappear up their own interface port and commune with the infinite, I figured that was their business.

Who'd have thought we'd all end up going to war over that bullshit?

My project partner Uma would say Element's the proof of a higher power out there somewhere, trying to help us reach it.

It seems that doctors are in high demand in these lands. I suppose that's no great surprise. The Island was no different. No matter. While my skills in the realm of medicine are more in line with a field medic than a true physician, I shall continue to play the role as long as it serves me.",

Based on their surprise when I showed them my new invention, my earlier supposition was correct: they've barely scratched the surface of Charge and Edmundium's full potential. Soon enough, I'll have surpassed their understanding of both.

Some of the details are fuzzy after that, but the next thing I knew, the artifact was gone. Instead, I was staring at an enchanting, diamond shaped object - a prism of raw, cosmic energy.

I didn't get the chance to examine it any further before Mei-Yin confiscated it for safety. I guess I can't blame her caution, but I'm fine! Really! Sure, my head feels like a cracked eggshell and there's still tingles running across my body, but I'm physically uninjured. Somehow I have to convince her to let me study it.

Yes, yes, there was a dragon on the other side. I'm sure Mister Nerva and his men fought quite the heroic battle, but discovering another slobbering beast is trivial in comparison. Imagine! One could go from one side of the globe to the other in the blink of an eye, and I'll wager that is just the start of the obelisk's capabilities! 

I must learn more! I must!",
Content/1507915891,"Before you are able to craft an item, you will need to harvest the necessary materials. You can harvest the items by interacting with objects on the ARK. When you are first starting off, you will want to pick up stones, punch trees for thatch, and pick berries from bushes. As you progress through the game, new tools, and creatures will become available to you to assist with harvesting, allowing the process to become more efficient and refined.",
Content/943411012,"Before you can expel this darkest of shadows, you'll have to hunt him down. For one so large, he hides quite well. It's vexing. I dislike it.

If you search for him blindly, you may search forever. So instead, call him to you. Use the voice of his lieutenants, and call out his name. Then he may appear before you, with all his wrath and fury. Then you'll have your chance.

But to speak with the voice of his lieutenants, you must take their hearts. Or if you can, take their minds, and pit their strength against his. However you do it, they are the key. You must begin with them.",

Convincing Raia was a lot less trouble. She knew the settlement's guards weren't exactly the cream of the crop, and that if I'd wanted trouble, I'd have already made it. When Raia talks, people listen. I can tell that much from watching her, but in a lawless place like this, words aren't enough. It didn't take long for us to come to terms.

The ""Master"" he speaks of is like a spirit of this land, and these artifacts are its talismans or fetishes. Perhaps these were the delusional scrawlings of a madman, but I cannot dismiss them. Despite his betrayal, Boris was no fool.

I do feel something when I look at the two artifacts we discovered. It is most likely simple nervousness, for I am unused to carrying such burdens alone. My parents believed that royal hands should be free of calluses, so I always relied on servants for everything, right up until the moment I snuck off to college.

I don't think I can ever return to that life. Not after all I've seen.",

I used one of the small, glowing creatures that the villagers keep as pets for my first subject. It was a timid, fragile thing, that is until I injected a full dose of pure, molten Edmundium into its veins. Then, as I predicted, it ascended! Within minutes it grew in size and power, until at last it was a mighty, fearsome beast!
Alas, that meddler Diana ""put it down"" before I could study it more closely. Bah! That was no mercy. That was as close as that worthless creature would ever get to tasting godhood, and she ripped it away! She is the murderer, not I! One day, she shall be punished for it.",

My pride and stubborn self-reliance has only ever brought me ruination.

I turned my stryder back toward where I'd left Nida, near the edges of this wheel.

I set aside my own desire to recover the mineral wealth I had lost once, and my half-memories of a previous life's pursuit of power.

There was only this moment, and this chance to do something right, for once in my miserable existence.

I pushed the machine to its breaking point, urging it into a full gallop toward the girl I'd abandoned to an unfair fight.

As I re-crossed that landscape shame gnawed at me, for the way I'd reacted to the dream she'd painted for me.

She'd only wanted to show me a sunset on the world I was destined to tame, far from these gardens she and her people had kept alive for a future they never thought they'd see.",
Content/2593591638,"By now, Mei-Yin and I can understand each other with only a handful of words. I just said I was sorry for being short with her, and that was that. She knows how much this means to me, and I know that she's just wants to protect me, even from myself.

I even told her about the images I'm seeing. She dismissed them as nonsense, but I'm not so sure. They're growing clearer with every day I spend studying the prism, and one in particular keeps coming up.

In it, I see a single room, in the depths of a cave. It is both a tomb and a throne - where a coffin like structure sits on a raised platform, surrounded by silvery metal and glowing crystals. The walls glimmer and a light shines down from above, or is it rising up from below? I can't tell.

What does it mean? Anything at all? Or do I really just need to get more sleep?",

I'm not sure how there's so much of it. Element wasn't nearly this common in our time. Granted, all the Element that those stations are made of had to come from somewhere, so theoretically this city could have been built on top of an undiscovered vein. This much of it would turn even the smallest village into a metropolis overnight. But if that was what happened here, then where's the mine? May need to take a few more readings.",

Together, the sanctuaries and the Obelisks that power them are the ancestor of every island that floats in the sky. They can all can trace their origins back to this single prototype. Though it is flightless, the core principles and technology behind it are the same.

In a way, that makes it your ancestor too. You were all born within the System, after all. Even if your design is somewhat altered, in a way, you're all its children.

One could say that when you fall, it will be something of a homecoming. In more ways than one.",

Species: Amargasaurus Titanicus
Time: Early Cretaceous
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Of all the creatures in the sauropod family, Amargasaurus titanicus is likely the most unique in appearance. It sports two parallel rows of dorsal spines down the length of its neck, back, and tail--though the neck spines are significantly longer than the back or tail spines. These spines are a remarkable adaptation, giving Amargasaurus unmatched control of its body temperature. Made even more marvelous by their time on this ARK, their spines store both extreme heat AND extreme cold, effectively allowing Amargasaurus to live comfortably in any environment. Its sails also make it an abnormally capable swimmer, for a sauropod. Unlike most sauropods, Amargasaurus is very prone to violent aggression, attacking most predators (and humans!) on sight. I suspect this behavior developed alongside the dangerous spines it uses as weapons.

Domesticated
Once finally tamed, it's no surprise that Amargasaurus' regenerating spines can be put to potent use. If removed early, their thermal storage becomes erratic, which is perfect for catalyzing sap extraction in large trees. Some tribes, inevitably, have adapted this thermal quirk for combat. By coaxing the Amargasaurus to eject a spine before it sheds naturally, the disruptive thermal waves which emanate from the spike can wreak havoc on nearby armor materials. Interestingly, simple armor is barely affected, while armors constructed of more complex attributes are rendered largely useless. Such a strange reaction, but then, little about this particular ARK seems sensible to me.",
Content/156785087,"Common Name: Andrewsarchus
Species: Andrewsarchus mongoliensis
Time: Middle Eocene
Diet: Omnivore
Temperament: Opportunistic

Wild
Andrewsarchus is a beast that’s full of surprises. These ungainly creatures might seem sluggish while foraging for a meal, but they can move unexpectedly fast when provoked. Like certain other whippomorphs, Andrewsarchus will aggressively defend its territory against interlopers.

With some distance between you, it may be possible to dodge a charging Andrewsarchus -- they don’t exactly turn on a dime. Just don’t expect a river or lake to protect you from one. As long as its feet can reach bottom, Andrewsarchus will plow its way right through deep water.

These scavengers will tear into just about anything if hungry, but they’ve got a bit of a sweet tooth. I've seen many an agitated Andrewsarchus pacified by some honey.

Domesticated
Once tamed, Andrewsarchus is a reliably fast beast of burden, as long as you don’t need it to take any corners at full speed. Its density in water also makes Andrewsarchus ideal for searching ocean floors for pearls, since it sinks so readily to the bottom.

The preferred saddle design includes a mounted minigun to target foes, while the driver stays safe inside their airtight armored enclosure. Though a fully-armored Andrewsarchus can't absorb as much damage as some of the ARKs' larger creatures, it still excels at harassing them.",

Species: Carcharodontosaurus medicupestis
Time: Late Cretaceous
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
I feel lucky to have crossed paths with Carcharodontosaurus medicupestis and lived to tell the tale. Though I’m not sure if this predator grows bigger than a Giganotosaurus, I hope never to find out. Just one of these bruisers held its own against an army of us, and that encounter cost us dearly.
 
Carcharodontosaurus can sweep aside attackers with its tail, but it’s the other end you’ll really want to avoid. It has teeth like steak knives, set in jaws strong enough to shred most prey. Even a near-miss will carve you up, but good.
 
Like its namesake the great white shark, Carcharodontosaurus gets more dangerous once it tastes blood. Each kill seems to give these monsters a rush and drive it into a berserker frenzy.
 
Domesticated
Anyone that manages to tame a Carcharodontosaurus will gain a new way to rally their tribe for battle. There’s something about this monster’s roar that drives others to fight — a war cry for Hell’s own army.
 
The more tactical tribes will let their Carcharodontosaurus tear through the mid-sized creatures in their enemy’s ranks, thereby building up its bloodrage to take on the largest threats. Talk about shock and awe!",
Content/2149689542,"Common Name: Desmodus
Species: Desmodus draculae
Time: Pleistocene
Diet: Sanguivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Even with all the other monstrosities around here, this fugitive from a Creature Double Feature deserves top billing. I mean, Dracula’s right there in its species name! And Desmodus has a shriek that’ll scare just about anything out of its way. It’s also shrewd enough to limit itself to victims that it can carry off into the night.

Although I’m not superstitious enough to advise stocking up on garlic and stakes before you decide to track down Desmodus for yourself, I’d still advise you to hunt these horrors out in the light and away from their caves – they seem uniquely adept at flying and hiding in those dark, narrow spaces.

Domesticated
Taming one of these beasties lets you add its eerie abilities to your arsenal. Use their unsettling scream to scatter your enemies. Command Desmodus to snatch up small prey for you. Let its uncanny power to vanish into darkness become your personal stealth mode.

Desmodus has blood thinner in its saliva, which drains prey of more blood than this vampire could ever digest. If you can stomach the excess blood and drained meat your vampire pet leaves behind, you might be open-minded enough to appreciate another of its unholy gifts: a 'sanguine elixir' that helps enthrall the most stubborn beasts.",
Content/965553820,"Common Name: Dinopithecus
Species: Dinopithecus anedmundius
Time: Pliocene - Pleistocene
Diet: Omnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
I believe Dinopithecus has been changed by ARK life. This species is definitely larger than any I remember from the fossil record. And these oversized baboons show a more pack-oriented behavior than I would've expected in their kind. Whole troops will organize around an alpha, and fall apart if that alpha is slain.

Though they seem to prefer a diet of fruit supplemented with the occasional bit of meat, Dinopitheci are opportunistic and will eat just about anything. They’re also excellent climbers -- I’ve seen them scramble up sheer cliff faces and leap between trees to scavenge food for their troop.

Dinopitheci will bare sharp teeth and toss well-aimed handfuls of their own excrement when provoked. Their feces is what really sets this species apart -- they’ve managed to weaponize a parasite in it that disables TEK! I feel like that parasite deserves its own dossier.

Domesticated
If you can manage to tame enough Dinopitheci, you’ll soon find yourself with a small troop at your disposal. Your mini-troop will organize around the strongest of your tames, their new alpha that can then direct them at a target with a shrieked battle-cry.

No need to saddle your tamed Dinopithecus to ride it -- it will make one for you using its own tail. Just hold on tight, and it will take you straight up walls and across ziplines.

In battle, your Dinopithecus will fling fecal projectiles, grenades, or a combination that I like to call EBM, for Explosive Bowel Movement.",
Content/1694165370,"Common Name: Fjordhawk
Species: Parabuteo veðrfölnir
Time: Mid-late Anthropocene
Diet: Omnivore
Temperament: Calculating

Wild
Most of the creatures I’ve encountered here have endured thanks to their great size, strength, or ferocity. But the fjordhawk gets by on its wits and by scavenging. The bird also seems to have an almost preternatural ability to predict and avoid danger. Fjordhawks follow predators (and survivors) from on high, watching for their moment to swoop in and snatch up an easy meal. 

Domesticated
Tamed fjordhawks are surprisingly playful, and their favorite game is fetch. Indulge your bird with this play and a bit of patience, and you’ll reap the rewards. Just point out a target, and your fjordhawk will fly off to retrieve it for you. A well-trained fjordhawk can locate injured prey and communicate its find to you.

These clever birds will bond with humans as wholeheartedly as any canine or primate, in a way uniquely suited to this time and place. If you should meet with some grave misfortune, your fjordhawk will immediately fly off with as many of your belongings as it can carry. As soon as you’re respawned by the ARK, your friend will track you down and return your equipment to you!",
Content/1963772336,"Common Name: Sinomacrops
Species: Sinomacrops Bondei
Time: Mid-Late Jurassic
Diet: Insectivore
Temperament: Docile… usually

Wild
Sinomacrops bondei is a friendly and curious little pterosaur. It may approach and investigate unfamiliar creatures, but Sinomacrops does spook easily. When threatened, it will unfurl its wings to reveal deimatic eyespots in an attempt to confuse or scare predators away. Still, Sinomacrops seems to be a highly intelligent creature that craves social interaction.

While it's normally curious and friendly, Sinomacrops' adorably oversized mouth turns into a deadly weapon at the slightest sight and smell of insects. Even alone, this cute little critter can take down insects far larger than itself. Unfortunately, this means that armor made from chitinous plates is going to trigger an attack response from the otherwise sweet-hearted pterosaur.

Domesticated
Taming a Sinomacrops is fairly straightforward (in theory) -- just feed them without scaring them. Once tamed, they absolutely love travelling with their humans, and prefer to cling to them whenever possible. 

Not only are they sociable, but they're fiercely protective once bonded. Any small creature approaching someone with a tame Sinomacrops will be met with its flashing eyespots and  piercing shriek. That’s usually enough to stun an undersized interloper.

For such a small flier, Sinomacrops can carry surprisingly heavy loads. It can even support the weight of a fully-grown human adult, though it will struggle to gain altitude. Still, any creature companion that can double as a glider and parachute is invaluable for anyone traversing an ARK... as long as they bring plenty of snacks for their new friend.",
Content/1530248558,"Common Name: Tropeo
Species: Tropeognathus mesembrinus
Time: Cretaceous
Diet: Piscivore
Temperament: Neutral


Wild
Up close, Tropeognathus mesembrinus is easily recognized by the keeled crests on its snout, but with wingspans of up to twenty-seven feet, you’re sure to spot it before then. 

These large wings are not only ideal for catching air currents over its ocean hunting grounds, but they also let Tropeognathus draft off of other flying creatures by flying behind them. While not the fastest flyer on the Isles, when combined with its remarkable stamina, this makes Tropeognathus well suited for long distance flight.

Because it’s on the wing so much, Tropeognathus is best snared by those riding another flier. I've noticed the more clever tribespeople using chain bolas to capture them while airborne.

Domesticated
Once tamed, Tropeognathus has proven quite useful to the people of the Isles beyond mere transportation. For example, its toothed beak can grind down many common goods to their base components, which is a great way to recycle items and gear! Well, so long as you have a rag handy to wipe off the spit...

That bite is punishing enough to crack armor and grind through it over time, and Tropeognathus can blow away flora and fauna alike with a gust from its wings. Air-to-air combat is where this creature really shines, though. And with the right tools, some survivors have managed to fit them with a saddle-mounted flak cannon and jet engine for maximum lethality. 

Trust me, you haven't lived until you've ridden a jet-powered pterosaur into a dogfight. Saddle one up and see for yourself - you can be my wingman anytime!",

Achatina
Species: Achatina limusegnis
Time: Holocene
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Passive


Wild
Found mostly in marshes and jungles, Achatina limusegnis is a very slow, very non-threatening land mollusk. It might be the simplest creature on the Island to hunt, and while it only provides a small amount of meat and chitin, an easy meal is always of value on the Island.

Unlike nearly every other creature on the Island, Achatina does not defecate normally. Instead, it secretes a thick, sticky substance. Achatina leaves trails of this slime, but the trails are so thin that they crumble to dust quickly.

Domesticated
There is a very disgusting, but useful fact about Achatina that causes tribes to seek to tame them: its secretions are chemically similar to the ""Cementing Paste"" and ""Organic Polymer"" used by many tribes for building materials. Tamed Achatina naturally accumulates this slime over time, which can then be collected at the tribe's convenience.

Legend has it that Achatina can be tamed with a special ""cake"" made from harvested crops & resources.",
Content/3619265363,"Common name:
Allosaurus
Species: Allosaurus therotribus
Time: Late Jurassic
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Smaller but faster than Tyrannosaurus, larger but slower than Carnotaurus, Allosaurus therotribus is the island's resident pack-hunting theropod. While most aggressive theropods are relatively solitary creatures, Allosaurus lives in groups of 3-4. One Allosaurus is the alpha, while the others are its mates or a beta male.

Like humans find value in forming a tribe, the Allosaurus has evolved to hunt in packs. Its saw-shaped teeth leave its prey bleeding and maimed, making escape difficult.

Once an Allosaurus slows a creature with its cutting bite, the rest of its pack quickly closes in for the kill.

Domesticated
Not everyone thinks a tamed Allosaurus is ideal. Those who appreciate speed generally tame Carnotaurus, while those who value raw stopping power tame Tyrannosaurus.

However, riders of Allosaurus tend to respect the utility of its Alpha pack status, which along with its bleed-inducing attacks and relative mobility, can effectively turn the tide of a combined arms battle.",
Content/1965642031,"Common name:
Ammonite
Species: Ammonitina multiamicus
Time: Late Jurassic-Mid Cretaceous
Diet: Feeder
Temperament: Passive

Wild
Usually found in the deepest parts of the waters around the Island, Ammonitina multiamicus has a strange relationship with the other creatures of the deep. It must do something beneficial for them since every nearby sea creature defends Ammonitina when it is attacked. What this distinct symbiosis is based on, alas, I have not yet discovered.

Ammonitina has also made its way into the deeper parts of many underwater caves. Even within these caves, the creature will draw attention if assaulted, making harvesting its resource-rich shell a tricky proposition, depending on what other dangers may be lurking nearby.

Like many of the untameable ocean dwellers, Ammonitina still has enough utility to be a valuable hunting target. If a tribe is willing to risk the wrath of nearby would-be protectors, Ammonitina bile can be harvested from the innards of its corpse. This bile can then be worked over with other chemicals to produce powerful concoctions, the most notable being a mixture that causes creatures to become enraged and attack the source of the scent.",
Content/2799229987,"Common name:
Anglerfish
Species: Melanocetus anglerpescum
Time: Early Cretaceous-Holocene
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Whether its size is caused by adaptation to the Island's other inhabitants, or by cross-breeding with another larger species, Melanocetus angerlpescum is the largest form of Anglerfish I've ever heard of. Typically found among the deepest, darkest expanses of the ocean, this creature preys on smaller fish while being an excellent source of food for larger predators.

Melanocetus has an array of bioluminescent light pods at the end of stalks on its head. Like typical Anglerfish, it primarily uses these to attract smaller creatures and trick them into coming close enough for Melanocetus to consume the prey. This often makes wild Melanocetus itself relatively easy to spot among the briny depths.

Domesticated
Exploring the depths of the ocean can be difficult. The cold, the lack of air, and the shocking absence of light combine to make travel very dangerous.

A tamed Anglerfish can use the natural light at the end of its stalks to illuminate the depths, making exploration not only safer but more lucrative, as I've heard some survivors use this creature to harvest the silica pearls found throughout the ocean's depths!",
Content/1066342864,"Common name:
Ankylosaurus
Species: Ankylosaurus crassacutis
Time: Late Cretaceous
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Docile

Wild
Unlike many of the herd animals on the Island, Ankylosaurus crassacutis tends to live in small family units.

I believe they can afford to stick with smaller groups because of their incredibly thick skin, for which they're named.  

Despite not being among the largest of the Island's herbivores, Ankylosaurus is one of the more difficult creatures to take down. Its thick, armored skin seems to make it more than a match for several of the mid-sized predators that would otherwise hunt it.

Reckless carnivores are just as likely to hurt themselves on Ankylosaurus' spikes, as they are to get hit by its tail.

Domesticated
Without a doubt, the best trait of a trained Ankylosaurus is its enormously dense tail.

This tail is powerful enough to quickly shatter the resource-laden rocks of the Island. 

One of the wealthier human tribes on the island utilizes a squad of Ankylosaurs in its mines and quarries. The creature's affinity for metal enables it to carry raw ore at an effectively reduced weight.",

Araneo
Species: Araneomorphus Amalgotantibus
Time: No equivalent, traits

Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
I don't know where to start with Araneomorphus Amalgotantibus. It has so many of the nightmare inducing traits of spiders from among many family and genus.

It fires webbing like a bola spider, and it spits venom like a lynx spider. It has a poisonous bite like a myriad of spiders, and can see in the dark by sensing vibrations.  

To top it off, it's larger than an adult human!

If that wasn't enough, I'm convinced that some of the caves on the Island have actually been dug by Araneomorphus, but this worries me; either it's a colony-spider (like ants), or there is a much larger Araneomorphus somewhere on the Island.

Domesticated
As long as it is kept far from arachnophobics, a domesticated Araneomorphus makes an excellent guardian creature for anyone who wants to avoid lethal tactics. Their strange web-spraying behavior is also certain to be quite helpful while hunting fast, fleeing prey.",
Content/1233930134,"Common name:
Archaeopteryx
Species: Archaeopteryx magnamilvum
Time: Late Jurassic
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Fearful

Wild
Approximately one meter long, the Archaeopteryx magnamilvum is a primarily tree-dwelling proto-bird. It avoids the ground as much as possible, preferring to stay in the safety of the tree-line, where few predators can reach it.

I've not seen an Archaeopteryx outright fly yet, so it's possible that they cannot generate enough lift to do more than glide long distances between perches.

I'm not sure how a creature so fearful of the ground can be such a picky eater, but Archaeopteryx only seems to consume certain rare insect matter. The most likely explanation is that it tends to nest in infested trees, stripping them bare of such food sources.

Domesticated
While not large enough to bear the full weight of an adult human, Archaeopteryx still has great utility. Despite the creature's inability to fly, its wings have sufficient strength to dramatically slow the rate of a person's descent, if that person holds onto Archaeopteryx while airborne. Taming Archaeopteryx can be somewhat troublesome, though, as it refuses to eat most common food sources, and glides to prospective safety at the first sign of any interloper.",
Content/1482751740,"Common name:
Argentavis
Species: Argentavis atrocollum
Time: Late Miocene
Diet: Carrion Feeder
Temperament: Short-Tempered

Wild
Lording over the skies across the Island, Argentavis atrocollum has few aerial rivals. It is a small consolation for the Island's other avian creatures, then, that Argentavis seems to have little interest in anything alive.

Quite apart from what I would have guessed, Argentavis does not have the stooped neck typical of modern buzzards and vultures. 

I don't know if it adapted this stronger neck to deal with the predators on the Island, or if its lineage derives from before the stooped neck became common in carrion-eating birds. Whichever it might be, it has enabled Argentavis to carry smaller creatures with its beak.

Domesticated
Argentavis is actually slower than the Island's far more common Pteranodon, but it possesses significantly more stamina and can sustain flight for approximately three times as long. Its weighty stature, in comparison to the Pteranodon, allows it to utilize its talons to support the weight of an additional passenger. Considering its saddle doubles as a mobile crafting station, it makes Argentavis an excellent creature for traveling and hauling cargo over long distances.

Arthropluera
Species: Arthropluera felsanguis
Time: Early Permian
Diet: Carrion Feeder
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
The fact that this creature even exists is enough to give me nightmares. Like the Island's other arthropods, Arthropluera Felsanguis has become much larger than I might have believed possible. It's a very aggressive hunter but greatly prefers to eat meat after it has spoiled, so much so that it voraciously seeks out such delicacies.

Arthropluera's blood has a very low pH, to the point that it can dissolve many materials. This acidic blood splashes back onto anything that directly attacks it, weakening the durability of melee weapons and hurting attackers. Many creatures thusly refuse to prey on Arthropluera, fearing this unique defense. If that wasn't enough, Arthropluera also keeps a small reservoir of blood ready to spit at its prey.

Domesticated
Like most of the Arthropods on the Island, Arthropluera is simple-minded and relatively easy to tame. It is an almost entirely military mount, useful mostly for attacking at a distance. Thanks to its unique defenses, whether hunting or warring, Arthropluera is generally safe from all but the largest of creatures.",

Baryonyx
Species: Baryonyx aquafulgur
Time: Early Cretaceous

Temperament: Passive to land
creatures, but aggressive to water-dwellers

Wild
Like the Carnotaurus, Baryonyx aquafulguar is a large carnivore, but not large enough to rival the Island's apex predators. While not as powerful as some deep-sea predators or Spinosaurus, Baryonyx is an extremely fast swimmer who is still sufficiently nimble enough to threaten most creatures on the Island.

And yet despite being a fast, dangerous dinosaur, Baryonyx almost exclusively consumes fish and other water-dwellers. The highly specific metabolism of Baryonyx seems to allow it to heal wounds almost preternaturally fast after feeding on nutritious fish meat.

Perhaps this is why Baryonyx rarely attacks land animals?

Domesticated
Baryonyx's natural affinity for aquatic predation means that once tamed; it learns to kill ocean-dwellers even more efficiently.

Between its speed and its power, Baryonyx makes an ideal choice for anyone interested in frequently moving between water and land travel, and who values speed and agility over raw strength.",

Basilosaurus
Species: Basilosaurus solatiumfecit
Time: Late Eocene
Diet: Piscivore
Temperament: Passive

Wild
One of the stranger creatures in the waters surrounding the Island is Basilosaurus solatiumfecit. It's a powerful swimmer which has adapted to the shallows so remarkably well that it rapidly recovers from injuries when near the water's surface. Conversely, it's vulnerable to deep water pressure, which slowly causes it harm.

Basilosaurus is usually closely followed by other predatory creatures, as its eating habits leave plenty of scraps for scavengers to consume. It is a gentle creature towards humans and happily laps up food directly from them. However, the creatures that trail the ""Basi"" tend to become dangerously enraged whenever this occurs, as it leaves no leftovers for them.

Domesticated
Despite the hassle of engaging with its ornery followers, many tribes still attempt to tame the Basilosaurus, as its mammalian, warm-blooded circulation provides a rider with perfect comfort from both heat and cold. Being apprehensive in nature, Basilosaurus is equipped with a defense mechanism that prevents it from being stunned or shocked. Alternatively, Basilosaurus is hunted (perhaps too vigorously) for its special blubber, which can be efficiently refined into gasoline!",

Species: Beelzebufo palucocus
Time: Late Cretaceous
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Languorous

Wild
Beelzebufo palucocus is the largest frog I've ever seen. Almost impossibly large, it can actually fit a fully-grown human adult on its back, though just barely. This is a dangerous prospect, though, as secretions from Beelzebufo's skin and saliva have a narcotic effect on most creatures.

Not surprisingly, Beelzebufo is adept at killing insects. Its lengthy tongue allows it to quickly grab prey from afar, killing most insects near instantly and quickly digesting them. It even combines the narcotic chemicals in its mouth with the insects' chitin to create a specialized sticky substance.

Domesticated
Tamed Beelzebufo make for strange mounts. Strange mounts for strange people. Many tribes don't believe there's any reason to ride them, but some enjoy the ability to take large vertical hops up huge walls and cliffs. Regardless of how it is ridden, Beelzebufo is also employed for its ability to quickly cull insects, and convert them into always-useful cementing paste.",

Brontosaurus
Species: Brontosaurus lazarus
Time: Late Cretaceous
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Docile

Wild
Among giant creatures I've seen on the Island, Brontosaurus lazarus is larger than any sauropod I've read about. In fact, the dinosaur is so massive that it serenely ignores most other creatures.

I've seen a pack of raptors tear apart small dinosaurs while Brontosaurus continues eating, seemingly oblivious to the hunting pack. 

Domesticated
Because of how docile it is, the Brontosaurus makes for an ideal pack animal. Peaceful tribes use it to carry incredible quantities of resources, while warring tribes use it to mobilize their army. Its size and strength make it one of the unique creatures on the Island that can support a ""platform"" saddle. Unfortunately, its enormity means that the process of taming a Brontosaurus can take a very long time.

Some may think this is an Apatosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Argentinosaurus, or some other sauropod, but this is a strange Island, and I'm the one doing the research. I'm convinced that this genus is Brontosaurus, and no one can tell me otherwise. My study, my rules.",

Bulbdog
Species: Microluminis Globulus
Time: Unknown
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Passive

Wild
Microluminis Globulus is best described as a slobbering, roly-poly ball of affection. Just like its kin, it is completely harmless, despite its pronounced fangs. So if a survivor sees one running towards them, they should prepare to be licked, not bitten.

Unfortunately, being so ugly that you're cute is not an effective means of self-defense, which lands it near the bottom of the food chain. Its Charge Light may intimidate some predators, but its attracts just as many.

Domesticated
While Microluminis Globus has skin reminiscent of lizards or amphibians, its behavior is incredibly similar to a common canine. This has made it a particularly popular choice as a companion and source of Charge Light, but remember - whatever shoulder you rest it on will be covered in drool within minutes.",

Wild
Carbonemys obibimus is one of the least aggressive creatures on the Island. Were it not for the plethora of predators on the Island, I'm quite certain that it would spend its days basking in the sun, eating, or sleeping. Carbonemys leads a simple, solitary life. Nevertheless, it seems to be one of the most peaceful animals I have yet encountered.

With its slow walking speed, the only things that keep it safe are its surprisingly fast swim speed, and its incredibly thick shell, which can absorb tremendous damage.

Domesticated
Carbonemys' swift swim rate, fairly high strength, superior shell defenses, and lack of real threat makes it an ideal armored mount for many survivors who shy away from violence. It can carry its rider to the ocean's resources at fairly high speed, and is not particularly dangerous to tame.",

Carnotaurus

Wild
Carnotaurus pressor is a distinctive creature that falls between a medium and large predator. It lives primarily on flat, clear ground, where it can capitalize on its speed. Additionally, it seems to have no qualms about running away from larger predators instead of fighting.

The horns of the Carnotaurus seem to be used more for fighting rivals than actual hunting. This doesn't mean the horns aren't dangerous, though. They can still eviscerate larger prey.

Carnotaurus is one of the smaller and more compact of the large predators. If Tyrannosaurus is the “lion” of the Island, Carnotaurus would certainly be the “cheetah.” The real threat of a Carnotaurus is not being able to escape it once it has spotted you.  

Domesticated
Carnotaurus fills a very specific role. Larger and almost as fast as a Raptor, smaller but much faster than a Rex.

Were it not for the creature's extremely long down-time after sprinting, it might be among the most capably balanced mounts.",

Wild
Castoroides feliconcisor is a large, mammalian herbivore that tends to live near water. Unlike other larger beaver species, this one retains the chisel-shaped teeth of modern beavers. As is typical for beavers, they build dams as habitats, but the larger creatures on the Island have a tendency to trample them. As a result, finding unsullied, resource-rich dams in the wild is quite rare.

Castoroides itself doesn't seem to realize how dangerous the Island is. I don't know if it's simply too dumb to notice the dangers, or if it just doesn't care... 

...but Castoroides happily goes about its day playing in the water and gnawing on wood.

Domesticated
The value of a tamed Castoroides is obvious from its physiology. The creature naturally gathers wood extremely efficiently, far more than most species on the island. It's not the strongest creature, so it can only carry limited amounts, but it is a natural lumberjack! Its saddle doubles as a mobile crafting station, which allows for producing complex items on the go.",

Found in small numbers within the Island's colder regions, Chalicotherium obsidioequus is normally a peaceful herbivore that prefers to spend its days lazing about or playing with its family. It is very territorial, however, and the entire family, young and old, will turn against an encroaching creature at just the slightest provocation.

A memorable scene to stumble upon is a group of Chalicotherium playing. One odd playtime activity for Chalicotherium is hurling large balls of snow or.. mud-rocks(?).. at each other. Smaller creatures in the area shy away from Chalicotherium during this exertion, for fear of being buried in snow or ""gravel.""

Domesticated
While many creatures are useful while attacking a fortress, Chalicotherium can be trained as mobile artillery. Its unique playtime habit becomes a rather devastating long-range assault tactic when it is given boulders to throw, rather than snowballs!",

Cnidaria
Species: Cnidaria omnimorph

Temperament: Passive, but aggressive
at close range

Wild
Cnidaria omnimorph is another example of a creature which should not exist. It has traits that seem derived from many types of jellyfish. It possesses the size and shape of large egg-yolk jellies, the powerful sting of certain box jellies, and the bioluminescence of deep-sea jellies. This all combines to make a dangerous creature that lights up the deepest reaches of the ocean.

Cnidaria is not generally aggressive, because it lacks normal perceptive senses. It generally just floats along on the current until something gets close enough to sense, at which point it attacks. While its attacks are not directly powerful, its sting injects an incredibly strong and fast-acting sedative.

Domesticated
As Cnidaria is barely more intelligent than a plant, there's no effective method to tame one.

Most tribes kill Cnidaria on sight, then collect its reserve of powerful sedative, to use in technically advanced long-distance tranquilizers.",

Wild
Coelacanth nutritia is one of the few creatures on the Island with a relative which can be found back home. The Coelacanth thrive in the waters around the Island, as well as within rivers and lakes. Unlike most Coelacanths, Coelacanth nutritia meat contains less oil and urea. In fact, it is one of the healthier sources of meat I've yet found.

Most Coelacanths are opportunistic feeders that eat anything smaller than itself, likely including baby water snakes, insect and plant life, and perhaps each other?

Domesticated
While their limited intelligence makes them unsuitable for taming, Coelacanths provide a viable source of meat for coastal or water-dwelling tribes. Many a day has been spent fishing by the water's edge, often with surprising results, as Coelacanths often have consumed discarded garbage that is sometimes of great value.

Due to their small size, though, a larger tribe would require a significant number of Coelacanths to feed itself.",

Time: Late Jurassic
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Curious

Wild
One of the smallest predators on the Island, Compsognathus curiosicarius can be seen as a pet, a pest, or a threat.

While alone, Compsognathus is not dangerous or aggressive. In larger packs, however, it remembers its underlying carnivorous nature.

After a group of Compsognathus grows to a certain size, their pack mentality always seems to embolden them to “attack.” 

For some reason, Compsognathus is not naturally afraid of humans. Rather, it seems to be quite curious about humans and their instruments of survival. They tend to be drawn toward humans out of this curiosity, and then call their pack mates to help explore their discovery. This usually leads to the aforementioned pack aggression, with dangerous results.

Domesticated
Compsognathus gain increasingly significant attack power and speed when in close proximity to other Compsognathus, as their pack aggression takes over their behavior.

Additionally, their distress call carries quite far, rapidly alerting the tribe and its pets to danger more efficiently, and increasing the likelihood of forming a so-called ""Compy Gang.""",

Wild
Daeodon comedentis is the largest known species of Entelodont, an omnivorous family of ancient mammals that are sometimes referred to as ""Hell Pigs."" Even though Daeodon has as many similarities to modern Hippopotamidae as it does to Suina, I've found that to be a suitable nickname.

Daeodon is as mean as it looks, and any survivor who wanders too close will find that out the hard way.

As an omnivore with a voracious appetite, Daeodon scavenges, forages, and hunts to survive. It has little qualms when it comes to its diet, and that has helped it thrive on the Island's harsh tundra.

Its temper hasn't hurt either, as many would be predators would rather seek out less vicious prey.

Domesticated
Many tribes have made excellent use of Daeodon packs within their war parties, not only because of its fierce nature, but due to its extraordinary ability to rapidly heal itself. I've theorized that this healing factor is why it seems to have such a high metabolism, though what is particularly extraordinary is its capability to share this benefit with nearby creatures.

I have even heard some survivors mention that the Daeodon also has a unique ability to root out Rare Mushrooms as well!",

Wild
By the time you hear the scurrying claws of the Deinonychus, it's often too late. Superior hunters, they leap from a hiding place and pounce on their prey. The Deinonychus is an agile climber as well, jumping from wall ledge to wall ledge as it seeks high vantage points to lie in wait. A hungry Deinonychus tends to be fearless and will hunt prey much larger than itself, latching onto a dinosaur's back with its sickle-shaped claws, then starting to feed before its victim is even dead. While it likes its meat fresh, a Deinonychus isn't above scavenging a carcass if no other food is available.

Domesticated
Raising a Deinonychus in captivity requires an ample food supply, as they have a fast metabolism to match their high activity level. The Deinonychus is also fiercely territorial near nests with eggs, even if the eggs aren't its own. This makes breeding successive generations a hazardous process. Unless raised from eggs, they cannot be tamed; the hunter instinct of a wild Deinonychus is so strong that it reflexively pounces on a would-be master.",

Wild
Dilophosaurus sputatrix is a strange creature. It stands at just over half the size of known Dilophosaurs and runs from aggressors as often as it fights them.

Dilophosaurus sputatrix has a few traits not common in the Dilophosaurus genus. It has a very shrill call, and a decorative ridge of skin on its neck. I believe these are used to attract mates, as well as intimidate prey and would-be predators. 

Instead of attacking its prey outright, Dilophosaurus sputatrix spits venom to weaken and paralyze it before moving in for the kill.

Because of their shrill cry and their ability to attack intruders from range, Dilophosaurus seem most suited as ""guard dogs."" Due to their small size, they are not suitable as mounts.",

Dimetrodon
Species: Dimetrodon calorector
Time: Early Permian
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Reactive

Wild
Dimetrodon calorector is a much calmer predator than most on the Island.

Because it lives off smaller prey than humans, it generally ignores anything much larger than a Coelacanth.

Dimetrodon is one of the few carnivores on the Island that could be classified as reasonably friendly in the wild.

The sail on Dimetrodon's back is an especially fascinating thing. It can be angled to provide shade from the sun and allows Dimetrodon to disperse heat more quickly.

The inner workings of the sail can also restrict blood flow in the creature to hold in excessive heat. Together, these two traits allow Dimetrodon to comfortably survive in any climate, though they are most commonly found in the swamplands which are rich in prey. 

Domesticated
If Dimetrodon was a bit larger, or didn't have that massive sail, it would make a decent mount.

However, its main use to survivors is to utilize the sail's insulating capabilities. Just being near Dimetrodon gives excellent protection from both heat and cold, which has saved my life through more than one ice blizzard in the frozen northlands.",

Diplocaulus

Wild
Presiding almost solely within the Island's swamps, Diplocaulus natatorinutrix is a small amphibian that primarily eats minor fish. It rounds out what I consider to be the middle-bottom of the ecosystem, feeding on the tinier non-insect creatures of the Island while itself being a common snack for the larger carnivores.

Because so many creatures prey on it, Diplocaulus has become very skittish and often flees at the first sign of trouble. It uses its amphibious nature to escape into whichever environment its predator isn't native to. Diplocaulus' unique capability to retain vast quantities of oxygen allows it to effectively remain submerged for hours at a time, usually outlasting even other amphibious creatures that might otherwise prey upon it.

Domesticated
There are only a few uses for tamed Diplocaulus. It is primarily kept for the (rather disgusting) practice of employing a Diplocaulus as an oxygen bag. Diplocaulus stores air in the bladders of its head, and divers can suck from these bladders to take deep breaths while submerged, supporting long-term underwater exploration without the use of external gear.

Surprisingly, Diplocaulus is also extremely efficient when it comes to hunting Trilobites.",

Diplodocus
Species: Diplodocus insulaprincep
Time: Late Jurassic
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Naive

Wild
Despite being one of the Island's largest creatures, Diplodocus insulaprincep is among the Island's smaller sauropods. Instead of size and intelligence, Diplodocus developed faster maximum speed and greater endurance. When fully matured, it generally only reaches about half the size of the rather enormous Brontosaurus.

Diplodocus is another creature whose continued survival on the Island confuses me. It's a very thick-headed and trusting animal, often to its fatal detriment. It never flees from predators until after they've attacked it repeatedly, preferring instead to make numerous fruitless attempts at friendship.

For some strange reason, Diplodocus trusts humans so much that it doesn't seem to fight back against them…ever!

Domesticated
Due to Diplodocus' smaller frame, it cannot support the type of ""platform"" saddle that other large creatures can. To make up for this, many tribes instead use an eleven-seater passenger saddle which enables Diplodocus to safely transport ten additional riders. These passengers often use ranged weapons to protect the creature, or to attack nearby enemies while on the move!",

Diet: Omnivore
Temperament: Territorial

Wild
Found primarily among the Island's redwood regions, Arctodus dirus is an imposing creature.

Many on the island have started calling it a Direbear, a name which is appropriate, both due to its enormity and its territorial nature. The Direbear ignores most non-hostile creatures while going about its daily routine of scavenging for meat and edible plant life...

...that is, until intruders enter the territory it considers its own, at which point the creature ferociously attacks. Most often, it is smartest to just run from an angry Direbear.

Domesticated
Once tamed, the Direbear is a strong and reliable mount. It can carry vast quantities of goods, and can sprint for extremely long, nearly infinite periods. It is not the fastest creature from a hard stop, but after building up momentum, its sustained overland speed builds to among the best of the island. Of course, being able to feed a direbear both meat and plant life makes keeping one fairly convenient regardless of the environment.",

Wild
The best adjective to describe Canis maxdirus is ""scary."" This pack-animal is a cunning and brutal predator, capable of taking down prey of nearly any size. In addition to being a vicious hunter, it is the size of a small horse, meaning even the largest predators aren't necessarily safe from the packs.

Unlike most creatures on the Island, Canis is a dedicated pack hunter, and rarely hunts alone. When in a pack, Canis are naturally spurred to fight for their lives with increased effectiveness, while the most experienced Canis will be designated “Alpha” and gain an even stronger enhancement!  

The species has an incredible affinity for teamwork. 

Domesticated
Obviously, Canis is a thrilling battle mount. It is fairly fast, very strong, and agile. It can leap almost as well as the Island's battle-cats. Riding a supercharged “Alpha” Canis into battle at the head of a bloodthirsty pack is a thrill for which most warriors would gladly proclaim: ""today is a good day to die!""",

Wild
Raphus replicare (more commonly known as the Dodo Bird) is quite possibly the dumbest creature I've ever seen in my life. It wanders around the beaches of the Island, pecking berries off bushes, and being eaten by all manner of carnivore. Without the Dodo, the whole Island's food chain would disintegrate.

This subspecies of the Dodo has developed an unbelievably clever way to sustain itself: they mate constantly. I'm fairly convinced that they reach full maturity within a week of being born.  This is the only trait keeping them populous on the island. 

Domesticated
While it can be done, there is almost no reason to domesticate a Raphus replicare. It cannot carry enough to be a beast of burden, it does not provide much food, and it's too stupid to show companionship. It could work as a last-ditch food source, though, so I suppose keeping some around for ""lean times"" has a certain logic.",

Doedicurus custosaxum is one of the Island's non-aggressive herbivores, generally found in the mountains and grasslands. Large and well-armored, it has a supply of fat under its plates to keep it warm and fed in the cold.

Doedicurus has adapted well to the dangers of the Island, perhaps even better than the Ankylosaurus.


Doedicurus has two very different reactions to predators. Against smaller foes, it generally uses its spiked tail to inflict as much damage as possible. Against larger predators, however, it pulls its tail underneath itself to form a solid armored ball that is nearly impossible for creatures to pierce, from which it can actually ""roll"" away to relative safety!

Domesticated
Doedicurus is a highly prized work animal on the island. Its spiked tail is ideal for quickly shattering the large rocks, so Doedicurus is a very efficient quarry worker. In addition, its affinity for rocks has allowed it to carry stone at a reduced weight. In case their quarry gets raided, Doedicurus-riders have a very difficult-to-kill mount!",

What magic created the Scarabidae gigas, I cannot say. What I can say is that this creature is a perfect symbiont for advanced human tribes.

Coprophagic, it eats mostly useless waste (feces). It metabolizes this waste into a more refined waste product, along with an oily byproduct.

The oily byproduct is chemically the same as the oil found in the oceans around the Island. Somehow, Scarabidae converts feces into oil. If that wasn't reason enough to worship the Scarabidae, the refined waste product is almost identical to fertilizer from a compost bin.

Domesticated
Scarabidae makes me think humans have been on this Island for a long time. Why else would a creature evolve to be such a perfect pet? Most tribes jealously protect their Scarabidae, which are handily tamed with the skilled use of some well-handled feces. These wondrous little organic biofactories are truly a sustainable, green, eco-friendly source of resources for living off the land. Oil becomes gas, which is generator fuel. Fertilizer means crops, which is human fuel. The Scarabidae can power all aspects of Island life!",

Dunkleosteus loricaruptor is a very strange creature. It is a fairly large fish, covered head to tail in armored plates, with incredibly powerful jaws. It tends to eat the Island's water-dwelling crustaceans trawling the seabed, as it is not fast enough to catch most of the smaller fish.

Dunkleosteus is surprisingly combat-oriented for a fish. Its well-armored body protects it from many creatures, while its bite is strong enough to easily crush through chitinous shells. 

Domesticated
Dunkleosteus is an incredibly useful fish for coastal communities. Its powerful jaws make short work of the stone and oil formations found throughout the oceanic depths. While harvesting, Dunkleosteus can defend its rider from all but the largest threats in the waters.

Occupying a space in the low-to-middle end of the food chain, Electrophorus beluadomito is a carnivorous swimmer that feeds mostly off of shellfish and small fish. Despite its common name, it is actually a very long Knifefish, and not an Eel. It does not provide much meat, so many predators simply leave it be.

Unlike most predators, it does not use brute strength to bring down its prey, but instead releases an electrical charge around itself to knock its prey unconscious. Alone, this can take out a small creature. When attacking together, Electrophorus can even bring down the larger ocean lifeforms, and then feed as a group.

Domesticated
By far, the most common use of Electrophorus is to subdue large ocean creatures. Knocking out a Plesiosaur or other giant deep-sea leviathan can be incredibly difficult...

Equus
Species: Equus magnus

Wild
Equus magnus appears to be an ancestor of the modern horse. Based on its stripes, it may be the African variant of Equus giganteus, which appeared in North America during the Ice Age, but that is pure conjecture. Its behavior in the wild is similar to that of other wild members of the Equus genus - it sustains itself by grazing, while keeping safe from predators by living in herds and outrunning its attackers via superior speed and stamina.

Domesticated
Horse and man have long been partners in survival, and this remains true on the Island. In Equus, survivors will find a trusty steed or pack animal that can carry them swiftly across land. Taming an Equus has proven interesting, requiring carefully approaching the creature in the wild, mounting it, and then carefully soothing over time by feeding it vegetables.

In fact, Equus' reliability has lead some survivors to construct special saddles for them. I even encountered a man who added extra saddle-pouches that doubled as mobile crafting stations for chemical supplies, foodstuffs, and other items. Although not as robust as what you might find within a village, this utility helped him live a nomadic, solitary lifestyle.

Some survivors employ Equus to herd and wrangle other creatures with a specialized lasso. This tool is sometimes effective for self-defense as well, as Equus is limited in battle on its own...at least compared to aggressive prehistoric carnivores.",

Found only in the deepest depths of the waters around the Island, Eurypterids are dangerous and adaptable arthropods. As likely to hunt as they are to scavenge, a Eurypterid rarely has difficulty finding food to keep itself nourished, even at the bottom of the ocean.

An Eurypterid's threat comes not directly from its raw strength. Instead, it combines a hard defensive exoskeleton with debilitating poison to powerful effect. The sting of a Eurypterid increases torpor while reducing stamina, quickly rendering its opponent unable to defend itself.

Domesticated
While Eurypterids are not intelligent enough to be tamed, this doesn't mean they are without utility to tribes. They are a wonderful source of chitin, and their digestive tract often contains Silica pearls.

Wild
In the wild, Apis lithohermea drones never stray far from their nests, which they build high in the Island's redwood trees or rocky cliffsides. Apis drones can be seen swarming around the nest in groups, but to get a look at the queen, one would need to crack open the nest itself. Speaking from experience, this is not a pleasant task, as Apis drones are quite territorial.

Take caution: Apis' stings will weaken their victim, and because its stinger is not barbed, Apis can sting multiple times without fear of its stinger being ripped out.

A tamed Apis Queen will lay new drone eggs and construct a nest that survivors can farm for honey, so long as they remember to wear a ghillie suit. Said honey is not only sweet and delicious but laced with strong scents that land mammals find irresistible. Many hunters use it to bait their traps.

Giganotosaurus furiosa is an enormous predator, larger even than the Tyrannosaurus or Spinosaurus. Getting cornered or run down by a Giganotosaurus can mean certain death for nearly any creature!

Fighting a Giganotosaurus directly is never a good idea, as its rage rapidly grows with every hit it takes. With this rage, it builds increasing reserves of energy to use, making its iron-jawed bites progressively more deadly and enhancing its stamina.

Add to this the fact that its huge body also enables it to take a tremendous amount of punishment, and you have a creature that is generally better avoided or outsmarted than attacked head-on.

Taming Giganotosaurus is a dangerous prospect. Its rage reaction, even when tamed, can sometimes cause it to briefly turn on members of its own tribe. Indeed it may even throw off its rider if it has been sufficiently angered!

Gigantopithecus fibrarator is a strange creature. It is usually quite passive, but it has a very short temper when it comes to its own personal space. Once another creature gets close, this gentle giant quickly becomes a rampaging beast. Best to give them a wide berth.

Gigantopithecus seems most happy to lazily lay about, picking berries from plants. Many Gigantopithecus spend much of their day in one small area, unless they are provoked.

Domesticated
In addition to being at home picking berries, a tamed Gigantopithecus can be taught to harvest the fibers found on many Island plants as well. It appears to be entirely content to pick at plants all day, eat the berries, and carrying fiber resources for its tribe.

Playful once tamed, Gigantopithecus seems to enjoy throwing its shoulder-mounted rider into the air. It probably feels that this activity is a game, but clever brigands can use this ‘game' to vault over walls and small cliffs.",

Wild
With a body reminiscent of a gecko, fluttery wings and a natural stockpile of Charge Light Microluminis Psykhe has an unearthly, if oddly charming appearance. A curious creature by nature, it always gave me the impression that it was studying me as much as I was studying it.

A favorite snack of many predators, this small lizard has no natural poisons, or any means of defending itself at all save for a swift retreat and its Charge Light. Survivors can approach it without fear.

Griffin
Species: Gryphon magnificum
Time: Unknown

Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Gryphon Magnificum is undoubtedly a sight to behold. Many ancient myths tell of various depictions of the Griffin over the ages, but what is never disputed is its majestic and mysterious nature. With the front half of an eagle and the back half of a lion, it is as if these two creatures somehow fused together to form a superior land and air predator. While one's first instinct might be to approach the creature and marvel at its beauty, that would be a very poor decision. Its range of attacks makes it one of the more versatile predators I've witnessed. If its presence alone isn't enough to intimidate potential hunters, it has the ability to dive from the sky to the ground with such force that it inflicts damage to anyone unfortunate enough to be below it, or carry its momentum back into a rapid uplift.

Domesticated
The idea of pacifying such a beast is nothing to scoff at. Its highly independent nature and disinterest with interacting with humans combined with its power and strength make the Griffin a challenge to domesticate. However, there have been those who are fearless enough to attempt and succeed at this miraculous feat. Once tamed, riding atop a Griffin along with a tribemate passenger, dashing through the air at high speed, is a prize in and of itself.",

Hesperornis
Species: Hesperornis avenatantes
Time: Late Cretaceous
Diet: Piscivore
Temperament: Passive

Wild
Possessing the appearance of a half-duck/half-dinosaur, Hesperornis is a medium-sized, fish-eating bird, common in the rivers and lakes of the island. It would be about two-thirds the height of a human if it stood tall, but it rarely does. Hesperornis spends most of its time gliding along the surface of the water, where it is much more maneuverable.

Hesperornis is barely a threat to any land-dwelling creature, as its legs are too short for it to move around effectively, but it is surprisingly fast in the water. It can easily hunt down fish and other small water-dwelling creatures. 

Domesticated
Not particularly useful for hunting, and not being affectionate, Hesperornis is primarily kept for the eggs it produces after consuming much fish. When rendered correctly, the eggs separate into two useful substances.

One is a protein substance that is high in calories, and the other is an oily liquid that is effectively the same as the Oil found in the ocean!",

Wild
Among the Island's most tenacious pack is Hyaenodon dirus, a carnivore most often found across the mountains and tundras in packs of 3 to 6. The Hyaenodon is a very intelligent predator. Before engaging, it determines if the payoff for a fight is worth the risk of injury.

Hyaenodon often prefers not to fight unless there is already weakened prey or a fresh carcass nearby. This temperament changes quickly, though, near the presence of injured creatures.  Hyaenodon quickly becomes very aggressive... 

...and the pack attacks with ruthless abandon. With each vicious chomp of scavenged meat, the Hyaenodon rapidly recovers health and stamina.

Domesticated
Despite being too small to ride, Hyaenodon are still popular pets. Their intelligence means they train well, and their natural pack mentality makes them excellent hunting dogs. Their ability to quickly recover health by consuming raw flesh off the bone ensures they can take punishment yet continue to fight, and they can efficiently preserve meat in specially-crafted saddle-bags. A common (and terrifying) sight on the tundra is a rider on a Canis with a pack of Hyaenodon at its side, howls and jeers echoing through the night.",

Wild
Among the most vocal creatures on the Island, Ichthyornis piscoquus actually appears to be a relatively normal seagull. It primarily eats fish, and its distinctive cries can be heard echoing over across the Island's many beaches. As you might expect from a seagull, Ichthyornis will flee at the slightest provocation.

Ichthyornis is a versatile and opportunistic hunter. Its primary form of attack is to dive into the top layers of water and impale its prey. However, since its food source can be unpredictable, Ichthyornis has developed a keen ability to steal food from unsuspecting travelers.

Their affinity for shiny objects leads them to sometimes knock tools and weapons out of the hands of unsuspecting Survivors, but Ichthyornis is too small to actually fly off with them.

Domesticated
Ichthyornis surprised me by being a very loyal and very social creature, once tamed. It likes to ride on its owner's shoulder, and bring that person treats (in the form of fish, of course) which its beak-grip enhances with extra healing vitamins. The personality of Ichthyornis reminds me of a housecat hauling a trophy prey back home, except it brings extra-healthy fish instead.",

Ichthyosaurus curiosa is a comparatively small carnivore found in the shallows around the Island. It is slightly larger than a human, but that's still small compared to the leviathans roaming these waters. It seems to be very interested in any creature around its size, often approaching and following humans swimming through its waters with a friendly nudge.

Despite its appearance, the Ichthyosaurus is neither a fish nor an ocean mammal. Like many creatures in the waters around the Island, it is an aquatic reptile.

Domesticated
I can't think of a better mount for someone starting to explore the Island's seas and waterways. Ichthyosaurus is a comparatively fast swimmer, and even in the wild will cozy right up to you and try to figure out what you're doing. Taming these is actually pretty easy, as they seem to love humans and can be fed & tamed without the use of violence.",

Iguanodon
Species: Iguanodon vicissitudinis
Time: Late Jurassic
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Reactive

Wild
Of the many creatures I've yet encountered on the Island, the Iguanodon vicissitudinis has the distinctly versatile capability of switching its primary method of locomotion according to its momentary needs.

Primarily a rather lethargic bipedal herbivore native to the Island's many grasslands and forests, in situations where increased speed or maneuverability is called for, it will quickly shift its posture into quadrupedal stance and behave like a very different creature!

While bipedal, it can employ rapid, stabbing attacks with its distinctive thumb spikes. In quadrupedal stance, conversely, it seems to have an endless supply of stamina, even while sprinting! 

Domesticated
Interestingly, the Iguanodon's thumb spikes also provide it with the capability to pick seeds out of fruits, allowing a farmer to easily convert stacks of fruits into stacks of seed for planting.

Combined with its highly effective fruit harvesting and substantial carry weight, the Iguanodon's excellent mobility in bipedal stance makes it an ideal field-hand that can also pull off a quick get-away or an agile defense when needed.",

Temperament: Friendly

Wild
Kairuku waitaki is an amazingly docile and friendly creature, to everything but fish. Honestly, I'm not quite sure how Kairuku manages to stay populated across the Island's colder climes, with the many predators stalking these frozen lands.

It is weak, and has only one small defensive trait: suspended in Kairuku blubber are small, dense particles that act as a light form of armor.

Adding to Kairuku's problems, a clever survivor discovered that refining Kairuku blubber (concentrating the particles in it) can yield a natural form of the same Polymer utilized in advanced tribes' manufacturing processes. This has caused many tribes to hunt Kairuku extensively, a practice colloquially known as ""Kairu Clubbing.""

Domesticated
There is no reason to tame Kairuku for combat, since they are useless at it. Still, Kairuku are regularly tamed for their cuteness and friendly nature, and the fact that their bodies run extremely hot. Just standing near Kairuku can help keep a survivor stay warm through long, harsh nights on the icebergs.",

Wild
A smaller relative of the Sarcosuchus, Kaprosuchus paludentium is water-based carnivore primarily found lurking among the island's swamps.

A naturally fast runner that is even faster in the water, it is a solitary hunter that picks off small-to-medium creatures, especially those isolated from their pack.

When attacking, Kaprosuchus uses two main tactics. First, it patiently waits below the water surface and when the target is sufficiently close by, will perform a lateral jump that it uses to quickly close distance with its prey and drag it underwater.

Secondly, its attacks the prey's vital areas specifically to drain its stamina. These two techniques effectively prevent most creatures from escaping Kaprosuchus once an assault has begun.

Domesticated
Survivors are generally split about the usefulness of Kaprosuchus. Some love its speed both in and out of the water, essentially making it among the fastest small-sized, all-terrain mounts when travelling through the wetlands. Others do not like how relatively frail Kaprosuchus is, and do not think its high speed and ensnaring attacks make up for this shortcoming.",

Karkinos Versatus is the giant cousin of modern crab species, with long, spindly limbs that remind me of the Japanese spider crab and a hard, stony shell. It is much more agile than its smaller brethren, but even more notable are its pincer claws.

In an extraordinary display of dexterity, Karkinos is able to wield each claw independently and precisely. This allows it to trap multiple targets in its vice like grip, or hold an enemy in one claw while it smashes a second foe with the other.

While Kentrosaurus aethiopicus is considerably smaller than its close relative, Stegosaurus regium, it is much more formidable in matters of self-defense. In fact, it is arguably the pound for pound champion of not only the Stegosaurus, but when encountered in close-knit fighting packs, ranks atop the Island's herbivorous dinosaurs in general.

Thanks to its wickedly sharp defensive spikes, any creature that attacks Kentrosaurus is likely to be reversely wounded in turn, and it is capable of piercing even the thickest of hides and armors when it goes on the offensive. I have personally witnessed the Kentrosaurus fell much larger predators in a single such ""impaling"" maneuver!

Underestimating Kentrosaurus can be a fatal mistake, particularly when it is in a herd. When travelling in numbers, Kentrosaurus seems to grow much more aggressive, increasing the range at which it will defend its territory.

Domesticated
Survivors have seen little success in their attempts to ride Kentrosaurus, owing to its spikes and hot-headed temperament. However, a tamed herd of Kentrosaurus can effectively defend a compound and take on larger carnivores. Once impaled by its attack, the Kentrosaurus slams the attacker on the ground continuously, helping to turn the tide of a pitched battle!",

It is difficult to be angry with Haementeria laetus, despite its rather terrible nature. The creature has practically no intelligence, and just attaches to any nearby living flesh in an attempt to drain that creature's blood.

Removing Haementeria requires precision bladework, or access to an open flame. Both of these can be nearly as dangerous to the host as to the leech itself.

Once Haementeria attaches to a host, it drains blood at a rapid pace, and the host experiences hunger, loss of health, and lowered stamina. Some Haementeria are also carriers for a dangerous disease I've dubbed ""Swamp Fever,"" which persists beyond the leech's own lifespan. Few creatures on the Island are transmitters for this disease, and it can ultimately be cured with a rare medicine.

Leedsichthys conviviumbrosia is the largest fish in the waters around the Island. Its meat is also extremely succulent, a surprise given its size. It is often traded with the same value as Prime Meat, and colloquially called ""Prime Fish."" Of course, not all of Leedsichthys' meat is this high quality, but most of it is!

While the demand for Leedsichthys meat is high, the fish is notoriously difficult to track and hunt. Between its large size, powerful attacks, incredible speed, and humankind's general ineptitude on open water.

It also has an excellent sensory system, often detecting vibrations in water from miles away. Large moving objects in the water such as rafts tend to overload their senses and cause them to become irritated. However, the viscosity of honey has been known to confuse its sensory systems and distract them once agitated. Actually killing a Leedsichthys is one of the Island's more difficult tasks. The hunt for an extremely elusive breed of the fish, the fabled ""Great Albino"" Leedsichthys has been known to drive otherwise-sensible men and women mad with obsession, as if all evil were visibly personified and made practically assailable in this one creature.",

Seeing the likes of Mammuthus steincaput alongside dinosaurs is still strange.

This behemoth towers over many creatures on the Island, and does not seem to fear anything but the Tyrannosaurus. Mammoths generally thrive in colder areas, and have a herd mentality.

I'm honestly not certain how the herds of Mammoths find enough plant life to graze on some of the Island's mountains.  

They must spend much of their time travelling between the mountains' cold summit and more lush base. Or maybe the Mammoth herds are the main reason the summits are so barren.

Here is another example of a creature that seems to have evolved beyond its historical traits. Everything points to this being a saltwater ray, but Manta mobula has developed the ability to swim into the island's rivers and shallows, as well as through the open ocean. Perhaps there were originally two types of ray on the island before, but years of interbreeding combined their lineage.

The rare ability of Megalania to effortlessly climb sheer environmental walls makes it a highly sought-after mount. While it is by no means the fastest, strongest, or toughest mount, the manner in which it can effortlessly scale mountains, clamber up barricades, hide in trees or upside-down, ensures it will always have place in any tribe's stables!",

Megaloceros latuscoronam is a very skittish herbivore, found mostly in the forests and mountains of the Island. Because of its large size, its fraught demeanor would be strange in any other place. But Megaloceros knows how fierce the predators of the island are, and that it is safer to flee from them than to risk its life in a fight.

The antlers of Megaloceros are very large, and make for an excellent source of keratin. This, of course, makes it a valuable resource. Unfortunately, hunting Megaloceros is not easy because of their quick speed and ability to bound over most obstacles.

Domesticated
Megaloceros is jack-of-all-trades creature, and many who ride it value its versatility.

It is decently powerful, and its resilience, speed, and ability to jump often come in handy. Finally, the male Megaloceros' charging horn attack tends to cause targets to “bleed,” decreasing their Health, Stamina, and Speed until healed!",

Were it not restricted to the waters, Carcharodon ultramegalodon would be one of the most dangerous creatures on the island.

As powerful and dangerous as the Tyrannosaurus is on land, Megalodon is near its equal in the water. In addition, it has a speed advantage over any non-aquatic creature when submerged.

Megalodons need large quantities of food to sustain themselves, so they attack most creatures immediately on sight. Smaller fish are the sole exception I've seen; I believe this is because they cost more energy for Megalodons to catch than the predator would gain.  

Domesticated
Having access to the resources and treasures hidden deep within the ocean is near impossible without a domesticated sea creature. The Megalodon, though difficult to domesticate, proves to be very useful when exploring the deep sea.

Wild
Much like the Island's other large theropods, Megalosaurus noctedominus is an aggressive cave carnivore that should not be taken lightly. Unlike most of the other theropods, it is a primarily nocturnal creature. As dawn approaches, Megalosaurus begins looking for a secluded place to spend the day sleeping in relative safety.

While Megalosaurus is not the most powerful theropod, it is still highly sought after by night-raiders. Due to its nocturnal nature, Megalosaurus becomes much more formidable at night, dodging attacks, conserving stamina, and attacking more accurately, to name a few of its enhanced talents.

Conversely, if disturbed during the day, Megalosaurus is significantly more sluggish. Either way, however, its primary combat tactic is to bite onto its target, then lock its jaw shut in an iron grip.

Only larger creatures can hope to break free once Megalosaurus locks its jaw. The creature then proceeds to gnaw on its prey until death. It's a terrifying, grisly spectacle to watch, and a formidable tactic for a tribe to employ against more nimble opponents.",

Meganeura quatpenna is an especially large species of dragonfly. Like most dragonflies, Meganeura is carnivorous, but it is not likely to attack unless provoked or challenged for food. It lives primarily in wetlands, such as the swamps. Meganeura is a natural predator of most of the smaller insects on the island.

While eating, Meganeura become very aggressive, which can be deadly for anyone or anything nearby if a large group has gathered around the deceased creature.

Domesticated
The size of the insects on the Island confounds me. The way these creatures diffuse oxygen should limit their size, but Meganeura (and other bugs) seem to be able to advance beyond this restraint.

Wild
Megatherium formipavor is one of the larger mammals on the Island. This is most shocking because it is essentially a giant sloth...if you crossbred it with an elephant and a bear!

Despite primarily being an herbivore, a typical Megatherium is very intent on consuming the Island's many insects. It is particularly adept at removing their insides without damaging much of the shell, maximizing extraction of chitin. The otherwise slow and peaceful Megatherium becomes faster and aggressive in the presence of these creatures.

Domesticated
Megatherium is an incredibly useful creature to tame, so long as you don't intend to fight other tribes. It's enormity, high resistance to torpor, and voracious attitude toward insects (and arachnids) makes it ideal for farming large quantities of chitin from the bugs of the Island, or simply defending against them.",

Domesticated
A common pet, Mesopithecus is very easy to keep fed. It will eat nearly any fruit harvested on the island. Mesopithecus is most often used as a social companion, as it cannot carry enough to be a beast of burden, is not large enough to be ridden and is not particularly good for combat. It is, however, quite effective at vocally warning of incoming intruders and pelting them with copious amounts of tossed fecal matter.

When hunting, Microraptor's speed is only one of its assets. While not quite capable of sustained flight, its wings allow it to stay aloft for several seconds while jumping. This allows Microraptor to attack its prey's vulnerable areas, as well as search for small river fish. Notable, the creature also tends to use this ability to knock oblivious humans off of their mounts.

Moschops Cibumutante in the wild is a lazy, cowardly creature that typically lives in the Island's forests, primarily making its home among the great redwoods of the western regions. It survives by being extremely flexible in its eating habits and completely averse to fighting. It never starves, since it can eat just about anything. It runs at the slightest provocation but is still often preyed upon.

Domesticated
What makes Moschops particularly interesting is what it can be trained to do with its eating habits. With a versatile palate and tough teeth, Moschops can be tamed for a unique ability: over time it can be accurately taught exactly which things to gnaw, increasing the likelihood of harvesting the specific resource its master desires. For example, teach it to prioritize chewing Prime Meat, and Prime Meat will be easier to harvest from the flesh it consumes. Likewise for rare plants materials, and so forth!

Just don't expect Moschops to protect you, though! Even after taming, it will quickly flee when enemies are nearby. Regardless of being fed well, increasing its strength, or how much affection, you shower on it, Moschops retains its inherent cowardly nature!  Its lack of combat might deter the use of this companion but the ability to ride Moschops while making use of its diverse harvesting is a rare treat.",

Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
The origins of the Nameless remain a mystery, but wherever they came from, these vicious creatures are nothing to scoff at, as they are rarely found alone. Common Nameless act in a subservient role to their pack's alpha, and will quickly heed its call to battle.

Though savage in nature the Nameless are deceptively intelligent. When hurt, they burrow underground to recover and protect themselves from further damage. Fortunately, they are highly susceptible to damage and burns from Charge based light sources, and exploiting this weakness can save a survivor's life.

Wild
Onychonycteris specuncola is one of the few omnivores I've seen on the Island. They seem to live primarily off the mushrooms and moss within the caves, but they attack almost any non-insect on sight.

They avoid Titanoboa whenever possible, which leads me to believe the snake to be a natural predator of Onychonycteris. 

While flying in the dark caves would be difficult for any creature, Onychonycteris' ability to use echolocation has allowed it to adapt perfectly. It can be found idly flying around the caves as often as it can be found hanging from bits of the cave ceilings.

Domesticated
Not large enough to be used as mounts, and not strong enough to carry much, Onychonycteris still function well as a guard animal.

Whether protecting a vacant home or members of a tribe, their relatively vicious nature has its uses. ",

Time: Early Miocene
Diet: Onnivore
Temperament: Friendly

Wild
Found along the Island's many inland waterways, Lutra Peloso have become exceptionally adept at hunting and foraging. This species of Otter has to be particularly cunning because of its diminutive size, and fierce competition for its preferred food source: fish. It is not a creature that excels at combat, and would not naturally pose an intimidating threat to any predators.

Finding packs of River Otters is simple enough: they are distinguished by their elongated bodies, bushy tails, and webbed feet. Their trusting and inquisitive nature ensures they are often hunted for their lustrous fur, but many prefer to tame them to become trusted companions.

Domesticated
There are few creatures which provide the companionship that Lutra Peloso does. Rather than traveling beside you, it would prefer to comfortably rest upon your back, providing insulation. Once domesticated, it can be told to harvest fish on demand, with a specific goal in mind... from the fish that it consumes, that Otter has a knack for foraging Silica Pearls, and can even yield a slight chance at finding Black Pearls within!",

Wild
Oviraptor Philodator is a small-to-medium sized carnivore, common in the jungles and beaches of the Island. Despite being a carnivore, Oviraptor's main source of food is eggs, which it steals from nests. Unlike any other creature, Oviraptor seems to be able to surreptitiously steal these eggs, usually without attracting the attention of an irate mother.

In an incredible feat of natural selection, Oviraptor seems to emit a chemical pheromone that affects many creatures as an aphrodisiac. Mated creatures are much more likely to…“create” new eggs while Oviraptor is around, which allows the Oviraptor to go about its business unperturbed.

Domesticated
Too small to fight or ride, Oviraptor is still one of the more commonly tamed creatures on the Island. Its pheromone ensures an increased stream of eggs from nearby mated wild creatures, for breeding, eating, or cooking kibble. Oviraptor will autonomously do the dirty work of stealing eggs from other tribes or wild dinos on your behalf, without attracting unwanted attention. They also make quite adorable sounds, so many children simply like to keep them around as rather strange companions.",

Wild
Since arriving on the Island, I have encountered dozens of fascinating creatures whose behavior has never been studied or documented...and also sheep.

Granted, Ovis arcam is quite different from the modern domesticated sheep - and even from wild sheep species such as Ovis orientalis.

The unique markings on its face give it a striking appearance, and the males' horns possess a unique shape that is unlike any other species in the Ovis genus.

As one might expect, Ovis stands little chance against this Island's many predators. Like the Dodo, its continued survival in the face of these challenges is a mystery.

Domesticated
Some survivors have found herds of Ovis to be useful in farm life. Their wool can be repeatedly safely shorn with the proper tools, and cooked lamb chops are a popular dish among some tribes, as is their hyper-nutritious mutton.

Every now and then, a survivor with a sense of humor will attempt to utilize Ovis as a mount, although the joke becomes significantly less funny once their slow Ovis is run-down by a pack of Raptors.

One tribe has grown particularly attached to Ovis, perhaps uncomfortably so. I don't know the tribe's actual name, but I refer to them as ""Sheep Lovers.""",

Pachy

Temperament: Passive

Wild
Pachycephalosaurus is a bit of a conundrum. It is a very passive (even friendly) herbivore, common to much of the Island. At the same time, it is one of the most dangerous herbivores that I have yet encountered on the Island. Its charging headbutt is a display of sheer physical power, and can kill much more quickly than you might think.

While Pachycephalosaurus is generally friendly, it has a short temper. Its fight-or-flight response always seems to choose ""fight!""

The Pachy becomes extremely aggressive once attacked.

Additionally, it is an incredibly fast sprinter, so escaping from an enraged Pachy is very difficult.

Domesticated
Pachycephalosaurus is an excellent battle-mount for those who want to ride a smaller, nimble combatant into the fray. Because of its particular musculature, it cannot effectively carry large quantities of resources. It can, however, move with brief magnificent bursts of speed, and its headbutt is simply devastating.",

Wild
Pachyrhinosaurus Mitisaura is a medium-sized herbivore, found almost everywhere but the Island's mountains. It is generally calm and ignores all other nearby creatures unless it is attacked.

Pachyrhinosaurus possesses a particularly unique survival skill. When threatened, its massive nasal-boss releases a chemical into the air that calms other nearby creatures, making them less likely to attack it. Affected creatures are sometimes hungry enough to ignore the effect, and humans seem immune to it. Conversely, it can seemingly invert this phenomenon at will and coerce creatures into attacking it!

Domesticated
Pachyrhinosaurus is an excellent starting mount for anyone new to taming. It is fairly easy to train, can carry enough to be a simple pack-animal, and is not as deadly as some of the larger herbivores. Additionally, Pachyrhinosaurus can release its unique chemical on command to protect itself and its rider from nearby predators, or draw attention if desired, making it a potential life saver in a pinch.",

Paraceratherium gigamicus is a massive, long-necked herbivore that inhabits some of the Island's grasslands. It resembles a gigantic horse/rhinoceros hybrid, but is over twice the size of either. Paraceratherium is a very peaceful and friendly creature.

Barring some surprises yet in store for me, I can safely say that Paraceratherium is among the largest mammals on the Island. While its size means that Paraceratherium can provide an incredible amount of food, it also makes it dangerous when hunted. 

Domesticated
A beast of burden second to the Brontosaurus, Paraceratherium is an excellent worker, and is sufficient in size to support a ""platform"" saddle upon which structures can be built. It is a naturally friendly animal, and is not afraid of humans. However, despite its normally calm demeanor, when it or its owner is provoked by aggression, the Paraceratherium can quickly become a real threat to the attacker and will use its girth to its advantage in combat.",

Wild
Parasaurolophus amphibio has one of the more interesting adaptations of any creature I've seen on the Island. Like all Parasaur, it has a signature crest on its head. Very docile at first, I've been able to approach the creature without disturbing it. If startled, however, the creature can vocalize a distress call to the surrounding area that warns of danger.

Parasaurolophus appears to be low on the food chain and is hunted by everything, creatures and humans alike, which explains its skittish nature. It is a good source of meat and hide, if you can manage to keep up with it long enough to kill it.

Domesticated
Despite being what most tribes consider a relatively useless creature to tame, I once met an interesting woman who had tamed an entire herd of them. She informed me that many overlooked the creature's potential. She even graciously gifted me a fancy saddle to put on my own Parasaurolophus one day.

As a relatively simple creature to domesticate, Parasaurolophus is commonly one of the first mounts a tribe will be able to acquire. Its ability to run relatively fast for lengthy intervals makes it a solid mode of medium-range transportation, though it has almost no ability to defend itself or its rider in a traditional sense. Smaller creatures, however, appear to be frightened by the horn of Parasaurolophus although it doesn't do much damage.  It also has decent weight-bearing capabilities, which could prove useful for nomadic tribes as they work to establish a presence on the Island.",

Wild
Among the bottom of the Island's dinosaur food chain is a small herbivore called Pegomastax fructarator. It is content to spend all day alone, gorging itself on far more food than you might reasonably expect for a creature of its tiny stature. Its beak appears perfectly evolved for collecting food from plants while avoiding indigestible fibrous strands.

Pegomastax is likely to spend its time greedily foraging; this behavior can turn it into a very aggressive (though rather unthreatening) opponent, shrieking and whooping far above its actual threat level. It has been known to steal belongings from humans on the Island, regardless of whether they're alone or not. You would expect a creature this small and weak to live in flocks, but Pegomastax seems to be rather solitary in nature.

While not pretty, and far too small to ride, tribes often keep Pegomastax around for two reasons. Firstly, they are an excellent farming aid, its skill at scavenging means that it collects an extraordinary quantity of seeds and berries, while also handily gathering rare flowers, mushrooms and other ingredients necessary to cook up special concoctions. The other reason being that tamed Pegomastax can be utilized by tribes to steal items from others. Their nimble feet and quick fingers allow them to get away with loot unscathed and potentially undetected!",

Time: Early Miocene
Diet: Piscivore
Temperament: Skittish

Wild
The much-larger ancestor of water birds like the stork or pelican, Pelagornis miocaenus shares many traits with its modern-day brethren. However, it seems to spend far more time hunting for fish over the open deep-sea.

In fact, I have rarely spotted a wild Pelagornis anywhere near the coasts of the main Island, as it prefers to rest its wings by paddling on the ocean's surface rather than waddling along the Island's beaches.

Perhaps this behavior is a result of its survival instincts. The Early Miocene was a post-dinosaur epoch, after all, and Pelagornis would not be accustomed to such predators. Considering how quickly it flees from humans, one can hardly blame its caution.

Domesticated
Because of its ability to fly, walk and surface-swim, a tamed Pelagornis is one of the Island's most versatile mounts, but this comes at a cost. The same webbed feet that allow Pelagornis to serenely maneuver along the ocean's surface prevent it from carrying prey off the ground, which may limit its appeal to some survivors.",

Wild
Phiomia ignavus is another of the Island's generally docile herd animals. They are small enough that almost any predator can bring them down but large enough to provide plenty of meat.

Were it not for the protection of the herd and their instinct to run from any predator, these would almost certainly be hunted to extinction. 

Phiomia's tusks and trunk make it especially suited to scavenging plantlife from the ground. It uses its tusks to dig up loose plantlife, then uses its stubby trunk to scoop the foliage into its mouth. Adult Phiomia often dig up food for their young, and watching a baby Phiomia attempt to use its trunk can be quite amusing.

Domesticated
While it is completely possible to ride a Phiomia around, they are a meager choice. They work very well, however, as pack-mules. If you feed the Phiomia a stimberry, it serves as a laxative in the creature's digestive system. Knowing this, tribal communities often keep a herd of these as livestock to produce mass quantities of fertilizer.",

Megapiranha magnadmorsus is carnivorous fish found fairly commonly in the rivers and ponds of the Island. Its bite is incredibly powerful; I've even seen them break through the armored turtles. Megapiranha has one of the strongest bites, pound-for-pound, of any creature on the Island.

When encountering a Megapiranha be on the lookout for the rest of the school. No one Megapiranha is an overwhelming threat, but their tendency to swarm prey can make short work of much larger and stronger creatures. Any given Megapiranha is easy to kill by itself, but killing the entire school can be a daunting task.

Elasmosaurus remuspissa is typically found in the deep oceans, and has a strange role in the oceanic food chain. It almost exclusively hunts the smaller creatures in the waters, leaving most even moderately large creatures alone.

Domesticated
Much like the Brontosaurus on land, Elasmosaurus is an excellent way to transport large quantities of goods over water.

The first marsupial I've encountered on the Island is the Procoptodon vivencurrus. Standing nearly three meters tall, it is among the largest jumping creatures I've heard of. It is a fairly peaceful herbivore that will immediately flee when aggressed upon.

One of Procoptodon's most unique features is its pouch. Unlike many pouched marsupials, Procoptodon's pouch is relatively dry and has little in the way of sticky or oily fluids. I assume this is good for the Joey, but I have not figured out exactly why yet.

Domesticated
Procoptodon's dry pouch makes it an excellent beast of burden that can carry far more than other creatures of its size. More importantly, many tribes use it as a two-seater transport by having a secondary rider nest in the pouch. Since this passenger doesn't have to worry about controlling the Procoptodon, the pouch-warrior can focus on firing his or her weapons!",

Pteranodon Wyvernus is a large pterosaur, capable of flying more quickly than any creature I have witnessed on this Island thus far. It seems to have relatively poor stamina in comparison to its quick speed, however, making frequent pit stops on the beaches before taking off again. While other humans I've seen on the Island still insist on calling it a Pterodactyl, this is inaccurate.

Pteranodon wyvernus's poor fighting and defensive skills mean they are likely to scavenge any number of dead animals rather than engage in dangerous combat with other creatures. They also flee at the slightest sign of trouble. Because of this, they are one of the most common creatures to be found darting across the Island's skies.

Domesticated
Pteranodons seem to be among most popular flying companions from what I have witnessed, possibly because they are relatively easy to tame with a slingshot or bow.

Mounting a Pteranodon must be among the fastest and safest ways to get around the Island, but it doesn't provide any measure of secrecy in comparison to travel on land through the dense foliage.  ",

From afar it's hard to believe that Quetzalcoatlus is the largest avian on the Island. It shares a similar silhouette with the Pteranodon but, upon closer inspection, is a far more enormous creature.

I find it strange that such a large, imposing beast would be so skittish. Unlike other creatures of its size, it is more likely to flee than fight. I suppose the decision to flee from any trouble keeps the species alive on an Island with so many dangerous predators. Which reminds me, I don't believe I've ever seen a wild Quetzalcoatlus touch the ground. How does it manage to eat enough to sustain its massive size?

Domesticated
Tamed Quetzalcoatlus have a very specific role on the island. Too slow to be an efficient local transport, and too obvious a target to be an effective warbird, the tribes I've encountered tend to employ it as a mass carrier.

Smilodon brutalis is a solitary hunter, generally found in cold, lightly wooded areas. The Island's mountains are the perfect habitat, as the mammal's fur keeps it safe from the bitter temperature.  While its huge fangs are excellent for delivering deathblows, the creature's claws can be just as deadly.

Despite normally being a solitary creature, Smilodon brutalis are not opposed to hunting in small packs. In fact, they have to do this to take down larger prey such as Mammoths.

Wild
Fairly unremarkable by the Island's standards, Oncorhynchus grexlamia is a generally passive fish.  Its main form of protection is swimming in a large school. Oncorhynchus does not like conflict, and generally swims away from anything larger than itself at very high speeds.

Once provoked, however, Oncorhynchus becomes quite aggressive, along with its nearby brethren. It locks onto its prey with its long ""saberteeth"" and begins draining that creature's blood.  This loss of blood is not too dangerous alone, but when a school of Oncorhynchus attack at once, their target quickly loses speed and stamina from blood loss, drowning if it cannot breath underwater.

Like many of the smaller fish found on or around the Island, Oncorhynchus cannot be tamed, but it is often herded and harvested for its resources. In particular, certain cuts of Oncorhynchus meat are considered to have superb quality, and are often referred to as ""Prime Fish"" used for specific high-end concoctions and taming the Island's many piscivorous creatures.",

Among the few carnivores on the Island that can match Tyrannosaurs in size, Spinosaurus aquareliga does not match its ferocity. Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette.

The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.

Domesticated
Spinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled. Although its movement speed is slower in a biped stance, it gains considerable attacking strength and mobility in this form.  For hunters who wish to have a well-rounded mount, Spinosaurus may be the ideal choice -- if they can acquire one.",

Stegosaurus
Species: Stegosaurus regium
Time: Late Jurassic
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Docile

Wild
Stegosaurus regium has approximately 16 paired rows of plates along its back, flanked by another, smaller pair of 6 plates. This is contrary to the alternating rows of Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. I've encountered Stegosaurus, in varying amounts, almost everywhere on the Island.

Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal. 

Domesticated
Stegosaurus is commonly used as a safe way to transport large quantities of goods. The plates on its back double as a cover against the arrows of attackers. It is capable of knocking back enemies with its large swinging tail, keeping the predator at a distance long enough for the rest of the tribe to provide backup. Its spiked appendage also helps it gather wild berries in large quantities.",

Tapejara
Species: Tapejara imperator
Time: Cretaceous
Diet: Carnivorous
Temperament: Skittish

Wild
Tapejara imperator is a marvel to watch in the wild. It has astonishing agility compared to the Island's other flyers thanks in large part to the rudder-like fin that extends from its snout to the back of its skull.

Initially, I'd thought the fin was simply composed of keratin, but closer inspection has led me to believe that it is actually some kind of sensory organ. Not only does it decrease Tapejara's turning radius even at high speeds, but it apparently provides Tapejara with extra information to help it fly through the air with unparalleled grace. I've even seen Tapejara hover and strafe side-to-side in the air without moving forward at all. It's quite remarkable. The creature also makes effective use of razor-sharp claws to latch onto surfaces such as the trunks of tall trees, holding its position indefinitely.

Domesticated
Warlike tribes appear to consider Tapejara the equivalent of a versatile rotor aircraft, capable of rapid positional changes and aggressive agility.

When domesticated the Tapejara is typically outfitted with a unique triple-rider saddle, enabling two passengers to wield handheld weaponry while the pilot takes the reins. When the Tapejara is latched onto a surface, both the passengers and pilot are able to make full use of their weapons together!

Evidently what this skittering creature lacks in distance-stamina, constitution, and weight carrying capacity, it makes up for in maneuverability and combat versatility.",

Wild
Ranging from eight to twelve feet tall, Phorusrhacidae rapidesultor is a highly aggressive avian that is just barely capable of very brief ""flight."" Instead, it uses its wings primarily for balance during its high-speed sprints. Phorusrhacidae flight is actually closer to an impressive sustained leap or glide that is assisted and lengthened by flapping its wings.

Phorusrhacidae shows interesting traits related to theropods such as Utahraptor, Carnotaurus, and Tyrannosaurus. It has many similar traits, such as general shape and predator patterns, but its attacks tend towards lightning fast dashes and beak slashes.

Domesticated
Phorusrhacidae is an effective combat mount, particularly for harassing and scouting. Riders of Phorusrhacidae gain most of the benefits of a fast, mobile ground-based theropod, while also gaining some of the freedom of movement from a flyer...assuming the rider can coax Phorusrhacidae into staying in the air over a long leap.",

Therizinosaur

Time: Late Cretaceous
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
I'm not entirely sure how Therizinosaurus multiensis stays populated on the Island. It is surprisingly slow for its size, and is a solitary predator (so no pack to back it up). I suppose the fact that its sheer power rivals Tyrannosaurus is the only thing that allows this very aggressive medium-sized predator to thrive.

The claws of Therizinosaurus are some of the most versatile biological tools I've encountered, as adept at removing trees and foliage from Therizinosaurus' path as they are at piercing the thick shells and hide of the Island's most defensive creatures if backed into a fight.

Domesticated
A tamed Therizinosaurus is one of the most versatile mounts a survivor can have. It can be trained to use its claws brutally or delicately, allowing the rider to primarily harvest with enhanced efficiency the specific kinds of resources that he or she needs. And in combat, these same claws can pierce straight through the toughest armor. This flexibility more than makes up for its inability to carry the large loads of the Island's many herbivorous beasts of burden.",

Time: Early-Late Pleistocene
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Thylacoleo furtimorsus is a large, powerful marsupial that can often be found hunting around trees among the Island's redwoods. Its long claws and semi-opposable digits make it an apt climber, a quality that Thylacoleo uses to its advantage while hunting. It clambers up large trees and waits to ambush passing prey by pouncing upon them. When something that large jumps onto a target, the victim becomes stunned and doesn't stand much of a chance.

Thylacoleo's most notable fighting quality is its powerful jaws. Once it bites its prey, it locks its jaw in an iron grip that can hold most smaller creatures in place. Thylacoleo then goes on to savage its prey with its sharp claws. If it needs to escape from a fight, Thylacoleo uses its muscular hind legs to jump back to safety among the trees.

Domesticated
Thylacoleo is a moderately strong mount, and its ability to climb trees and jump long distances makes it useful for traversal. As such, developing tribes often tame it. Small raiding parties particularly favor Thylacoleo, as it is well suited to ambushes and unfair fights!",

Titanoboa

Wild
Typically found within the Island's caves, Titanoboa exornantur is an aggressive creature that prefers dark, rocky areas. This extremely large snake, while being a member of the Titanoboa family, does not constrict its prey as most boas do. I believe this adaptation comes from coexisting with giant insects. However, the Titanoboa's venomous bite is so potent that it is known to paralyze far larger creatures.

Titanoboa has developed a strange coexistence with other creatures of the Island's caves.

Being immune to knockout poisons, and being unable to pierce the thick chitin of the insects, the species have learned to coexist. They often hunt large prey together.

As they appear immune to knockout poisons, Titanoboa exornantur is basically impossible to render unconscious. Because this crucial step can't be done, I'm convinced that Titanoboa are not tameable.",

Wild
Titanomyrma is one of the smaller creatures on the Island; a frightening thought, when you realize it is the size of a dog. 

A hive-minded carnivore, Titanomyrma is aggressive on sight to humans and their creature companions. When attacked or threatened, it releases a chemical which alerts all other Titanomyrma in a large range to help fight the aggressor. 

While small, Titanomyrma remain a threat because of their bite. Titanomyrma mandibles produce a toxic venom that causes loss of stamina, preventing escape and increasing the chance of losing consciousness.

I've seen two varieties of Titanomyrma: Drones and Soldiers. Drones are smaller, faster, and land-bound, with the intent to harvest for the colony. Soldiers are larger, slower, have wings, and they defend the colony. If Titanomyrma is akin to hive insects, there must be queens too, but I've yet to encounter such a variant.

Domesticated
Because of its hive mentality, I've not seen any successfully tamed Titanomyrma on the Island yet. Fortunately for lone survivors, separated Titanomyrma can be easily picked off for a small supply of chitin among other natural resources.",

Titanosaur
Species: Titanosaurus vagacastrum

Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Passive, unless approached


Today I witnessed an unforgettable sight: the extremely rare Titanosaurus vagacastrum. Essentially a walking mountain, it is an absolutely enormous Sauropod which has developed armored plates of bone protrusions all over its body.

Between these plates and its unparalleled size, Titanosaurus is extremely difficult to put down. In addition, Titanosaurus seems outright immune to any sort of narcotic effects. They often inadvertently crush nearby creatures underfoot with every step they take.

While most Sauropods ignore non-hostile creatures, Titanosaurs take issue with creatures invading its personal space. This is probably because they aggressively feed off any and all plants they can find. Titanosaurus eats constantly, which certainly helps recover health quickly, even after fighting off numerous carnivores such as Giganotosaurus. 

Domesticated
If ever a creature were too big, it would be Titanosaurus. You'll hardly see a Titanosaurus with just a saddle and a rider: its immense size can effectively carry a fortress, defensive emplacements, along with a small zoo. Although the Titanosaur can be domesticated, it's believed the process causes the creature to slowly starve to death from its subsequent refusal to eat.",

Apparently a crossbreed of a Triceratops and Styracosaurus, Triceratops styrax has both the characteristic three-horned face of Triceratops and the prominent horned-ridge of Styracosaurus.

Normally a very docile grazing animal, Triceratops becomes aggressive once angered. Triceratops will chase down would-be predators (and egg-stealers) with incredible prejudice.  

I've seen Triceratops have an especially hostile reaction to the Tyrannosaurus, with herds attacking en masse. While not very fast, they are deadly in a group.

Quite possibly the most intelligent non-human creature on the Island, Troodon magnanimus is an incredibly fast learner. It understands meaningful experiences much faster than other creatures (including humans), and its social nature means it also teaches its packmates, making them smarter too!

If Troodon's cleverness didn't make it formidable, then its tactics and biology would. It specifically pack-hunts at night when we are most vulnerable, and sees humans as its primary prey. This audacity is made especially dangerous due to its serrated fangs' poison, which drains stamina from any creature, but outright paralyses humans.

Thankfully, Troodon is fairly small. Were it larger, it might well have become the dominant creature of its ecosystem.

Domesticated
I thought Troodon simply could not be tamed, until I finally saw a lone survivor with one. She told me that she let ""Troody"" hunt a few of her tribe's smaller creatures for sport, and it eventually started following her everywhere. It seems that while Troodon is too intelligent to fall for the rote conditioning of ""tranq-and-feed,"" it can instead gradually gain loyalty from a social approach that provides it with the opportunity to hunt. Ever since, I have wondered at the benefits which a pack of ultra-smart, bred-for-battle Troodon may bring to a tribe brave enough to earn the favor of these clever carnivores.",

Tusoteuthis is a terrifying opponent for several reasons. Firstly, its grab slowly renders its victim unconscious, so death isn't the only concern.

Coelodonta utiliserro is a friendly herbivore, common to the tundra and grassland regions of the Island. It is a large and dangerous creature, though it seems fairly trusting of the fauna around it. Once attacked, Coelodonta begins charging towards its foe. It builds up momentum as it charges, and depending on its ultimate impact speed, the results can be terrifying. With enough room to charge, it can even skewer the largest creatures in just one gore!

Despite how powerful Coelodonta are, many tribes still hunt them extensively due to their unique resources. Its horns can ground into a highly arousing powder, and its thick fur can support many insulating outfits, making the Coelodonta in high demand. Even less-advanced tribes use packs to hunt them down, though at significant peril.

Feathered creatures are not necessarily viewed as dangerous predators in the same light as other theropods. However, the Yutyrannus strikes fear into even the Island's most skilled hunters.

There are few wild predators that are able to pack-hunt alongside the generally hostile Carnotaurus, like the Yutyrannus does, with such ease. It is also the only creature I've seen to consistently induce a state of panic in opponents with its roar. Upon hearing it, most creatures in the area will flee for safety.

A domesticated Yutyrannus can be a powerful offensive or defensive addition to war parties. With its mighty roar, it can induce fear in opposing creatures. Meanwhile, Yutyrannus can be trained to develop a confidence-boosting Battle-Cry which counteracts enemy attempts to induce fear, while also bolstering the resolve of allies, and may even draw wild Carnotaurus to its aid. These unique ""leadership"" qualities make the Yutyrannus a versatile, and at times, a necessary creature to have on your side during large-scale confrontations!",

When provoked, it becomes very aggressive, even against larger creatures it has no business fighting...often to its own fatal end. Dimorphodon can make short work of smaller opponents, however, due to its large (but lightweight) skull and teeth.

Barely over a meter tall, Dimorphodon should be low on the food chain, but its incredible speed and surprisingly strong bite make it fairly dangerous, especially en masse as they tend to attack in groups.

A flock of angry or hungry Dimorphodon can take down prey several times their size, so survivors should take care not to hunt near where a flock is gathered.

I've seen how Element can alter the evolutionary trajectory of a species in small, indirect doses, but this goes far beyond that. The Element that grows within these animals has taken hold of their minds and driven them mad. They move as one, ravaging everything in their path, and often push themselves beyond their physical limits.

We've found they have a sixth sense for Element, and on occasion have used that to our advantage. Otherwise, they are an unfeeling, ravenous horde.

It shares some similarities to some segmented worms, namely the aquatic Eunice aphroditois, but it's biology doesn't seem consistent with other members of the annelid phylum.

However, the ""death"" part of its name could not be more spot on. Khorkoi is without question the apex predator of this desert. It will devour anything that dares to set foot in the Endless Dunes, regardless of size or ferocity.

Khorkoi spends most of its time burrowed beneath the desert sands, exploding to the surface only to devour its prey in a single bite. The only chance of surviving a Khorkoi attack is if its initial lunge misses, as it's momentarily immobile afterwards. Theoretically, that could provide a brief opportunity to escape its territory. I wouldn't count on such luck, though.

Lymantria is occasionally used as a one man flying mount, but its ability to produce silk and spores is often considered more valuable due to its slow flight speed. Its silk can be weaved into heat-dispersing cloth, and its spores gathered for fertilizer or poison.

Thanks to its extraordinary digestive system, not only can Macrodryadis eat just about anything, but it can also turn a diet of scraps into a mountain of precious resources.

Instead of producing excrement, Macrodryadis grows glittering crystals upon its back, which fall off when they reach their full size. Shattering these crystals can yield precious resources, as Macrodryadis is somehow able to transmute the materials it eats into something entirely different. 

One of our pilots likened the process to the gachapon machines from his memories of growing up in Japan, and I guess the name stuck.

Though its crystals prevent Macrodryadis from wearing a traditional saddle, if its rider is willing to sit in a basket that hangs from Macrodryadis' neck, then they'll find its long claws are well suited for mining resources.

It was always hypothesized that a member of the Tardigrada phylum would be the last species on Earth in the event of a global apocalypse, so in some ways, the existence of Mopsechiniscus fluitobesus is completely expected. Its size and method of travel, however? Less so.

Mopsechiniscus is slow and ineffective in a fight, so to survive, it tends to choose flight - literally. First, it inflates itself like a balloon, briefly slowing down and gaining durability. Then it launches itself into the air by expelling gas through a series of sphincters in its underbelly, which it also uses to slow its descent.

Yes, it's as...unusual as it sounds, but Mopsechiniscus makes the most of its inflatable nature. In addition to jumping, it can use its stored up gases to push back aggressors, or even float on water.

Draconis auragelus appears to be directly related to the stealthy Draconis obscurum. Their stature, gait and ability to dive through the air are all similar. However, where Draconis obscurum scaled cavern walls to gain the high ground, Draconis auragelus takes a more bombastic approach.

In the middle of its hind feet, Draconis auragelus' bones form a hollowed out cylindrical shape that acts as a combustion chamber, which it fills with an explosive gas. When ignited, this gas propels it upwards, letting it ""jump"" in the air multiple times. From there, it can create a smaller burn in said chambers to hover in place, or dive at its prey.

Like the icy variant of Draconis vipera, Draconis auragelus can slow down its foes with its frigid breath - though it's able to take this one step further and freeze its prey solid. Perhaps that's because it's used to living in the tundra environment on the surface, as opposed to a desert.

Colossus petram is like no creature I have ever encountered. There is no biological or historical precedent for it. Its nearest relatives exist only in legend – mythical statues that could come to life like the Golem of Prague. That makes it all the more dangerous. What survivor could possibly expect a seemingly benign rock formation to suddenly spring to life and attack them? Fortunately, Colossus petram's massive size makes it quite slow, so I would advise most survivors to flee immediately if encountering it in the wild.

Colossus petram survives by slowly absorbing nearby minerals while in its dormant state, which consequently means that its body contains a wealth of metal ingots. If undisturbed, it can maintain this hibernation ad infinitum, but it will viciously attack anyone who encroaches upon its territory. A solitary creature, Colossus petram lives alone, and will not even protect its own kind.
Domesticated
If somehow tamed, Colossus petram could prove to be an invaluable asset, particularly in a siege. Only armor piercing rounds or explosives can harm it at all, and it will handily smash through stone structures.",
Content/204704532,"Common name: Snow Owl
Species: Bubo chinookus
Time: Post-Holocene
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive

Wild
Discovering Bubo chinookus was a pleasant surprise. Owls are remarkable creatures, but they're not the type that could survive an extinction level event on their own. Since it never strays from the patch of frozen tundra we encountered, I believe the Obelisk was the key to its survival.

Clearly a descendant of modern Strigdae, Bubo shares many traits with its smaller ancestors. For example, it excretes waste in the form of pellets, which make excellent fertilizer, and their large wings let them save energy during long, silent flights. They even hunt in the same way: by diving towards the ground to attack their prey with powerful talons. 

However, these talons also secrete a chemical with a high freezing point to slow down their prey, and they can even unleash this chemical in a wide cloud, temporarily freezing their foes. 

Domesticated
With its swift flying and frigid attacks, Bubo makes an excellent single-rider support mount or scout. The later is helped by its tremendous vision, which it can share with its rider via its antenna. Not only does this make enemies easier to see, but Bubo can also spot Element veins with ease, even when they're underground.

Content/3240543247,"Common name: Spiny Lizard
Species: Moloch sagittarius
Time: Holocene
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive
Wild
Though survivors have come to call these gargantuan reptiles Spiny Lizards, I believe that Moloch sagittarius' closest known relative is the Australian Thorny Devil (Moloch horridus). Besides the obvious gap in size, most of the differences between Moloch sagittarius and its smaller relative lie in its thorns.

Instead of being permanent parts of its skin, Moloch sagittarius' thorns are more like spines or quills that can be removed and regrown. In fact, it is even capable of shooting these spines from its tail as a method of self defense, and examination of these projectiles has revealed that they are coated in a lethal poison.
Domesticated
Despite its dangerous spines, Moloch sagittarius has proven to be an excellent mount for indirect combat. Its ranged attacks can wreak havoc in a pitched battle, particularly if other creatures are taking the enemy's attention. Additionally, Moloch sagittarius is able to gather wood rather effectively, making it more than just an option for combat. Once saddled it can be used as a workbench, allowing for a mobile crafting station.",
Content/3574632936,"Common name: Velonasaur
Species: Velonasaurus spinavultus
Time: Post-Holocene
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Omnivore

Wild
Velonasaurus spinavultus dwells in the small desert found outside the abandoned city, which is particularly fitting, because it looks like it's growing several cacti right on its face.

As unfashionable as its facial fins might be, I recommend keeping a close eye on them. While said fins are folded inwards, Velonasaurus behaves like your average therapod, attacking with claws and teeth. However, when those fins are spread wide, Velonasaurus can rapidly fire a storm of spines at its prey. However, while in this state, its mobility is greatly hampered and it will eventually wear itself out. 

Therefore it sometimes prefers to unleash its spines in a single, deadly burst. By spinning around and firing a salvo of spines at the same time, Velonasaurus can defend itself from every angle at once. 

Domesticated
Given its versatility, Velonasaurs spinavultus makes an excellent single rider mount in most combat situations, but it's particularly effective when defending an entrenched position. It's like a living, breathing gatling gun. Just be careful when giving it a congratulatory hug or pat on the head. Getting spined by your own war steed would be a rather embarrassing way to go.

Content/659524420,"Common name: Vulture
Species: Torgos arcam
Time: Early Pleistocene
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Docile
Wild
Torgos arcam appears to be a relative of Torgos tracheliotos and Torgos negevensis – commonly called lappet-faced vultures – which are native to the sands of the Sahara, Sahel, and Negev deserts. Like them, it is a carrion bird that feeds on the decaying corpses of other animals, and is only aggressive when defending its meal. As such, survivors should take note when they see groups of Torgos arcam circling above. It means that a wounded creature or a bloody battle may be somewhere below.
Domesticated
Despite its impressive wingspan, Torgos arcam is not suitable as a pack animal, and is surprisingly light. Some survivors have even been known to keep a tame Torgos arcam perched on their shoulder.

Interestingly, Torgos arcam is capable of storing raw meat in a separate stomach where it will decay at a slower rate. Tribes could, in theory, utilize this feature to preserve meat for recipes.",
Content/3072759599,"Common name: Wyvern
Species: Draconis vipera
Time: Unknown
Diet: Carnivore
Temperament: Aggressive
Wild
Like its relative from the Island, the Draconis vipera that inhabit the aptly named Dragon Trenches are creatures straight out of European legend.

Aside from size, the main difference between Draconis vipera and its larger cousin is that the former possesses only two legs, like an avian. Otherwise, it is quite similar, with armored scales, leathery wings and the ability to spew projectiles from a pair of glands inside its mouth.

The nature of these projectiles is tied directly to the color of Draconis' scales. Some spit fire while others unleash poisonous acid or even bursts of bioelectricity.
Domesticated
I can imagine no flying mount more deadly than Draconis vipera. Its strength, toughness and ability rain death upon one's enemies makes it unmatched in combat. The few creatures that it cannot immediately overpower, it can outmaneuver.

The ridges on its back form a natural saddle, to the point where many riders prefer to ride Draconis bareback. Curious indeed. However, Draconis vipera is too resilient to domesticate once it has become an adult. It must be raised from an egg if you wish to garner its loyalty.",
Content/1315717289,"Common names: Jerboa
Species: Renopila amplexus
Time: Unknown
Diet: Herbivore
Temperament: Cowardly
Wild
Scientifically speaking, Renopila amplexus is an adorable little fuzzball and I just want to hug it forever. Unfortunately, being harmless and lovable is inadequate as a defense mechanism in this wasteland, and that means Renopila is at the bottom of the food chain. It's an easy meal for predators and survivors alike, the latter of whom also value its hide.

The locals refer to Renopila as a Jerboa, but while it does look similar in some ways, it is clearly unrelated. The fact that it does not hop is a dead giveaway. In fact, while Renopila generally fits into the clade Glires, it seems to share traits with both rodents and lagomorphs.
Domesticated
In addition to being the cutest little companion in the desert, hours of close study and/or cuddling have taught me that Renopila has an instinctive understanding of this land's weather patterns. When the weather is about to change, Renopila will suddenly start behaving differently, so taming Renopila does have practical uses that can justify its perch upon one's shoulder.

Not that I need justification, but I'll take whatever excuse I can get.",

It's not that the rumor was wrong. There are buildings, all right: crumbling, abandoned buildings that are half-buried in sand...and home to a group of damned wyverns that attacked us on the way in.

Fine. Let them have their temporary victories. Let them imagine that they have inflicted real wounds upon us. When I obtain the power of the obelisks, they will pay for every blade of grass they take from me. With that power, I will make them know true regret.

The last thing I remember is a sharp pain in my side. When I awoke, I was alone with Wuzhui. Both of us were covered in blood, but Wuzhui's wounds were deeper. I cannot fathom how he carried me to safety in such a state.

For example, celebrating the gods with feasts and festivals in their name would be wasteful. This sacrifice is particularly unfortunate, for my students deserve some sort of reward for their diligence.

Perhaps I can still organize a modest celebration of some sort. In fact, maybe the whole village should have one, just to raise everyone's spirits. Even our venerable Captain might enjoy that. Ah, but I ask for miracles.",

I suspect that it has extremely strong metallic bonds and therefore a much higher melting point than any conventional metallic element.

I must find a proper base of operations where I can run more extensive experiments. I mustn't be overeager, however. I have limited samples and...

Drat! I shall have to ruminate on this later. A sandstorm may be brewing and I have no desire to be caught in it.",

Though we lack the resources to properly inter the dead in tombs, we still held a ceremony in their memory, and I made time to speak privately with anyone who wished to.

Once I got used to the armor, my experience as a warrior helped me learn quickly. I can already outpace Juzi in a race and beat her in the sparring ring. I try to go easy on her now. She helped me a lot so I do not wish to shame her.
I should call her by her proper name too, but Diana sounds too serious for a woman that laughs so much. Juzi fits her better. She doesn't mind it, but I don't think she knows I've named her after an orange.",

It is like playing a game of words.

One such caravan arrived yesterday, bearing a haul of metal ingots. Our venerable Captain has suggested that I bring a contingent of guards to the negotiations, but I would rather not. If our guests are intimated, they may back out, and I would be remiss to waste such an opportunity.",

Confound those confusing contraptions! Despite my best efforts, I could make neither heads nor tails of the consoles I found in that starlit sanctuary. 

If only I still had that jittery, bespectacled assistant of mine from all those years ago. What was his name? Gerald? Gerarde? The one that loved tinkering with the devices we'd salvage from the arms of the Island's less fortunate inhabitants. Good lad. The inscriptions he found on the inside of those little trinkets were where I first saw the word ""ARK,"" as I recall.

Shame about the incident with the Compsognathus. If I still had his services, perhaps I'd never be in this God forsaken desert. Ah well. Stiff upper lip, Rockwell! Make the best of it.",

Even at this distance, the great obelisk is beautiful. It is like a pillar of Amun-Ra's light given solid form. I wish we could have made our camp right beside it, but the others thought that might draw unwanted attention. At least we are close enough to be in its shadow, and drink from the river that runs beneath it. 

I always face it when I pray to Hathor, and though I can feel the skepticism in my companions' gazes, my faith is unshaken. For it was my faith that guided us here, to this place rich with water and resources. All agree that it is the ideal location for a settlement.

Wherever we are, the gods are watching over us. I know it.",

Greetings and salutations, dear reader! If these words are gracing your eyes, then you have had the good fortune to find the journal of Sir Edmund Rockwell, stupendous scholar, gallant gentleman and explorer extraordinaire.

It also means that it's entirely possible that I've met some unseemly end on this fascinating but exceedingly dangerous island that I call home. I suppose you could have also stolen it or I could have misplaced it, in which case please proceed to either hang your head in shame or return it to me at once. Whichever is appropriate.

I had to pick the desert. Why the hell did I pick the desert?

Well, I suppose ""pick"" is a rather strong word for it. I'm still not entirely certain just how I got that console working, but it suddenly started cycling through holographic images of different space stations similar to the island one that I'd been living on.  Of course, I just had to go and press another button while it was showing off one that contained miles and miles of bloody desert, and here I am.

That's just typical of me, isn't it? Always leaping, never looking. Oh well, better make the best of it, and by that, I mean ""better not die of heat exhaustion.""",

I've lost count of how many sunrises I've seen since I arrived on this island. Hundreds, I'd imagine, yet each one seems more beautiful than the last. Sometimes, I like to take Athena out just before dawn and watch it while flying through the morning sky. It's in these simple moments that I realize just how lucky I am.

Not that I was unhappy exploring the reefs and rainforests back in Oz, but I wasn't ever going to spot a bronto stomping about the outback, was I? Since I got here, I've had the opportunity to study creatures that no other biologist has even witnessed. I'll always be grateful for that.",

Where am I? How did I arrive?

I have asked these questions many times since I awoke on this foreign shore, but I must stop. They do not matter. Their answers will not save me, so I will focus on a different question – how can I survive? This question always has an answer, though it is ever changing, and it has helped me find resolve in moments of uncertainty or fear.

Just days ago, I never thought I'd fear again. I thought my fear died with the Yellow Turbans. Yet when I see a great lizard turn its eyes on me, I know fear is exactly what I feel.",

I am armed and clothed now, though crudely. My stone spearhead makes me long for my village's weaponsmith, but it serves. I use it to hunt the slow, fat birds that wander the coast. I do not know how such creatures survive here at all, but I am grateful for the meat they provide.

I save my arrows for the more dangerous creatures – like the lizards with ears like fans, whose spit burns the things it touches. No, not just the creatures. They are not the only danger. Yesterday, I found footprints in the sand that were not my own. I am not alone.

I am reminded of my first command in Dacia. Many men questioned my rank, wondering why they had to follow a Centurion so young. It took time to earn their trust, but it was necessary. I could not have even a single soldier questioning me in battle, lest our discipline fail. Without discipline, our century's formation would crumble, and the legion would be exposed. It is the same here. These ragged men and women will not become a unit overnight, but I am patient and more experienced than I was in Dacia. I may be far from the Rome, but I know this for certain – this island will know its might.

I'd been holding out for a change in weather before studying the wildlife of this island's peculiar tundra region, but I think it's safe to say that it's not forthcoming. Clearly this planet has no axial tilt, and therefore no seasons. That ice and snow isn't melting anytime soon.

Can't say I'm happy about it. The cold and I are not best mates, I can tell you that, but I'll just have to suck it up. The climate during the jurassic and cretaceous periods that many of this island's creatures hail from was fairly uniform, so an arctic region is quite the oddity. It'd be plain stubborn of me not to have a Captain Cook.",

My hunting skills are seriously out of practice. Not that I was ever spectacular, but I feel like I'd graduated from smashing bugs with a rock at some point. 

At least I was thoroughly rewarded for my efforts. My hunch was spot on – these big green bastards are carrying drinkable water on their backs, and thank goodness for that! I may have never known if I'd killed a red one first, since those carry oil instead. Far less useful when you're dying of thirst, let me tell you.

I may be fighting the inevitable, though. I'm still on foot and still alone. Definitely miss Athena…",

Right then! Now that I have found a shady spot where I can enjoy a brief respite from this desert's dreadful heat, it's high time that I set some goals for this expedition. If I wander about aimlessly, then I'm sure to meet the same fate as poor Gerald.

First, I shall find a local tribe, if for no other reason than to obtain a proper mount and supplies.

Second, I simply must learn more about the strange metal that lined the walls of the sanctuary. Even with a cursory study, I could tell that it possesses wondrous properties. But where could I find more of it?",

Sometimes the pennies a man won't part with willingly are worth less than the words he'll share with any stranger. Some of my new partners don't see that.

Blondie's particularly blind to it. He's always looking for an excuse to pull the trigger, and he's stubborn as hell. He even still gets mad we call him Blondie, as if any of us can pronounce that name of his.

But if Blondie were calling the shots, that hunter wouldn't have told us about the group gathering to the southeast, and they'll have a lot more for the taking than animal hides.",

The wondrous properties of the flora on this island will never cease to amaze me. If I'd told my colleagues in London that I could create a concoction capable of erasing someone's memories, I'd be laughed out of the room and never invited to tea again. Yet here it sits: my Mindwipe Tonic.

As usual, I've had tribal leaders grovelling at the gates of Rockwell Manor just for the tiniest of samples, and for the recipe? Oh the bounties I've been offered! I'm not interested in their riches, though. I have their protection, supplies for my studies and all the time in the world. What more could I ask for?",

Defending my hometown during the uprising taught me more in months than I learned in all the years before it. Among those lessons – men will always underestimate women in battle, and humans can be crueler than any animal. Both applied today.

The footprints I found were not from one man, but three. Their eyes changed when they saw me, like wolves discovering a lamb. They were wrong. They were merely mutts. I was the wolf. Two died to arrows after ignoring my warnings. The last to my spear. I left their bodies out in the wild.

I'm on a roll. By sheer coincidence, I stumbled into another group of survivors today, and they didn't try to kill me or anything! If I didn't know how probability actually worked, I'd say that this recent string of good luck is the universe making up for sending me to the bloody desert in the first place.

The caravaners were welcoming, and the creatures they ride are fascinating. They seem like dinosaurs, but they also appear to share some biology with camels. Bizarre! For all its oddities, the island never had anything like that.

I'll have to study them...after a nap. All this desert survival's left me knackered.",

The Blackthumbs are mad that the Painted Sharks sunk two of their barges, but the Painted Sharks say that the barges were too close to Southern Haven and they were perfectly within their rights to sink them, as per The Southern Isle Accords. Typically, neither side is willing to budge.

What a bother. I'd just as soon mindwipe the lot of them and return to my studies. Alas, such is the fate of the island's most respected neutral entity. At least The Painted Sharks brought some fresh fish. Perhaps I'll side with them.",

Any chemist worth his salt knows the irreplaceable value of testing. Until a tonic has been rigorously tested, it is less useful than water. If only I could persuade this island's less intellectual inhabitants to see that! Tests on Mesopithecus serve well for early trials, but they are no replacement for genuine human subjects at later, safer stages.

By subjects, I of course mean willing participants that are prepared to risk mild headaches and much less mild nausea for the sake of science. The Laughing Skulls offered rather less willing participants at one point, but I declined. With how difficult it is to find volunteers these days, I sometimes regret it.",

Eureka! At last, I have found signs of human life! 

This afternoon, I came across a fresh series of footprints, some from humans and some from what I assume are large beasts of burden. I cannot be sure who made them or how civilized they may be, but neither can I afford to be too particular in my choice of saviors. 

Whoever they are, I must track them down immediately. As soon as I gather my strength, I shall pursue my quarry with the utmost haste and vigor. The tale of the brilliant and impeccably groomed Sir Edmund Rockwell shall not end this day!",

If I'd ended up on this station instead of that island, I'd have never imagined the ecosystem was natural. Not for two seconds. 

Take these morellatops: they're a cross between a ceratops, a morelladon and a camel, and the strangest part? There are places in its humps where you can stick a spigot and get clean drinking water. Tastes like piss, but not only is it safe, it doesn't even harm the morellatops. It's crackers!

Definitely the result of genetic engineering, but I knew that, didn't I? It's time to get to the ""why."" Maybe studying the creatures here with my new perspective will yield some insight.",

Our settlement has grown so quickly during these hectic months. So many wandering souls have found their way here seeking shelter and companionship. I have done my best to welcome everyone I can. If treated with understanding, most become productive, loyal members of our community.

But I am no fool. I know that hearts can have two natures. Hathor offers compassion while Sekhmet brings devastation. As we grow in size, we become a riper target for those with malice in their hearts.

Girisha has tried to organize a militia, but I fear it inadequate. For now I must be wary, and pray that the gods send us a true warrior.",

Today, I scored a great victory.

As the sun set, I happened upon a small village on a bluff. Unfortunately, it was besieged by a man who rode a lizard like a horse and wielded a stick that spat fire. It would have been safer to retreat, but I could not ignore the bodies. This was a slaughter.

Surprise can be a warrior's most powerful weapon, and I wielded it effectively. My first arrow found the lizard's throat, and many more pierced the man's back once he tumbled from the saddle. He never saw his vanquisher.

In hindsight, I should have spared the beast. A mount would be welcome.",

It took longer than I had hoped, but the gods have heard my prayers. At least, I believe so. When I imagined what a true warrior might be like, I cannot say that I imagined Captain Dahkeya.

He speaks tersely, has no sense of decorum and in general is rather prickly. He was nigh unapproachable for a whole day when we decided his position should be called ""captain"" instead of the nonsense word he proposed.

Yet he has been getting results, or so I am told. When I find time, I ought to observe him in action myself.",

Miss Walker's impromptu visits are always an unexpected pleasure. After that headache with the Sharks and Blackthumbs, a lively tea-time discussion about the abnormalities of the ARK's ecosystem was precisely what I needed. Thank goodness I've managed to find a intellectual colleague that shares my love for the sciences!

It saddens me to think that Miss Walker's charming colonial accent would keep her out of the more prestigious institutions and societies back home. Another of the ARK's wonders – it is a true meritocracy, unlike any in the modern world. If Miss Walker and I could find and cultivate more minds like ourselves, we could create a true scientific utopia.",

Salvation, thy name is Prophet's Rest!

After a proper meal and some time out of the sun, the makeshift fortress doesn't look half as grand as its name might imply. Yet when I first sighted its walls from across the dunes, it may as well have been El Dorado itself, so grateful was I to find it. 

Thus far, I have seen little of the inhabitants, but they seem a hospitable sort. I've been given food, shelter, and even a wet cloth to clean myself with. Quite generous of them, considering how scarce water is in these lands.

Their clothing is a curiosity, however. Those robes seem more ceremonial than functional.",

The surviving villagers let me claim the lizard rider's armor and weapons, and gave me shelter for the night. To my surprise, I understood them. Their mouths moved strangely, but in my ears I heard the language of my home. They say it is the work of the metal object in my wrist. I do not understand, but they had no reason to lie.

That night, I dreamt of the uprising, but this time I was Lieutenant Guan, lifting the siege on my village in a single, gallant charge. Yet when I woke, I was just Mei-Yin, and the villagers were gone. I am a stranger to them, but my heart feels heavier for their loss.

As absurd as the Death Worms are, I see their purpose. They are a natural barrier. 

If this whole place is a space station posing as a real ecosystem, then it needs to keep the wildlife and humans inside it contained in a way that appears natural. The island accomplished that by simply being an island, and the desert does it via the Death Worms.

Granted, a large population of predators with ludicrous kilocalorie needs would never last long in a place devoid of prey, but as this is an artificial environment, the station can feed or replace the Death Worms as needed. It's a little convoluted, but it makes sense.",

It did not take long for me to grow accustomed to the weapons of this world – many of which are called ""guns"" according to one of my lieutenants. They are far more accurate and deadly than any bow, but like any weapon, they are only as effective as their wielder. In the hands of the Blackthumbs, they are of no concern.

In battle, we have been able to bait the Blackthumbs into attacking a wave of durable but disposable beasts before descending upon them with our main force. Our attacks are concentrated while theirs are scattered. That makes all the difference.

The villagers had made taming beasts sound simple, but my first attempt was nearly my last. My prey was the same kind of two legged lizard as the raider's steed, what the villagers called a ""raptor,"" but this one was strong. Even as my toxin laced arrows knocked him out, he was able to make one final lunge for my arm. He nearly took it.

Carefully, I fed him scraps of meat as he rested, and when he finally woke, I kept my weapon trained on him. Only when I was sure that he was docile did I notice his appearance – all black, save his white shins and feet. Right then, I named him Wuzhui, and while I do not believe in fate, I felt that this beast would carry me home.",

I never thought this island was normal, exactly. I mean, there are giant obelisks floating in the sky, for Pete's sake. Not to mention that cave I found, which hid a platform similar to those found at the base of said obelisks. Well, similar except for those oddly shaped holes that were carved into its podium.

I guess I just didn't care about all that. So long as I had my beautiful, unique and untainted ecosystem to study, I was happy. But now…

No, I shouldn't write it off just yet. Not before I arrive at Rockwell's. There's still a chance that my data is off or that I missed something obvious. I won't give up on my paradise just yet.",

So it went like this: I ride some tram thing to like, the biggest, weirdest zoo in the universe, right? Only instead of normal animals, there's dinosaurs! Totally cool...until they all escape just like in every horror movie ever made. Duh! Anyway, Dream-Me hops into a truck with some ripped, badass dudes, and we just start driving around, shooting dinosaurs and stuff. I felt like a legit action hero!

So I guess this place isn't exactly the same. There's dinosaurs, but I don't have guns or a truck. Also I'm completely alone... 

But it's still just a dream, right? I mean, obviously! I don't even know why I'm writing this down, it's all in my head. All I need to do is walk off that cliff, and I'll wake up right before I hit the ground.",

 I had to fight my overwhelming urge to retreat again.

This close, I could plainly see how thin the glass was holding back all the land, water, and air from the cold void beyond.

The girl had dismounted her stryder by some sort of metal podium.

I climbed down off of my machine to join her.

 She paid no mind to my approach, and went on tinkering with something near the base of the podium.

 I fumbled through a pathetic apology directed at the back of her head, with no sign that she'd heard me.

Eventually, Nida stood up and touched a switch on the podium that opened a huge, circular door in front of us
.
The girl climbed back onto her stryder without a word, and headed through the doorway.

 I scrambled to catch up and follow her into that other wheel.",

Name: Scout
Model Number: UAV RQ-7Y
Fuel: Element
Threat Level: Low
Primary Function: Reconnaissance

Field Observations
By itself, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle RQ-7Y is hardly a concern. Though many of them can be found monitoring the empty streets the abandoned city, they're not aggressive, and their offensive capabilities are limited. 
If attacked, they rely on bursts from their thrusters to either take evasive maneuvers or ram the aggressor, and they have no real armaments to speak of. This makes obtaining intact processing cores and spare parts a trivial matter, and as a result we've constructed a number of our own.

Personal Use
Shifting some of our resources to focus on RQ-7Y construction has been more than worth the investment. I managed to turn our TEK binoculars into a remote control system for them, and as a result our scouting teams have been able to cover more ground with far less risk. They simply deploy the RQ-7Y with a specialized grenade, then use its enhanced vision to scout ahead, scan for allied IFFs and track targets.
Just don't try to ride the damn thing. I didn't think I'd have to explain that considering how small it is, but three crashes later, here we are...

Name: Enforcer
Model Number: AGV MQ-9X
Fuel: Element
Threat Level: High
Primary Function: Direct combat

Field Observations
With its speed and teleportation capabilities, Autonomous Ground Vehicle MQ-9X is built to close gaps quickly and engage its targets in close quarters. Once in range, it uses refined Element claws with lethal force.
MQ-9X was clearly designed for urban combat. Its claws and shock absorbers let it scale walls and drop down to street level from significant heights, and we've only seen it patrolling within the city limits. Possibly the remnant of an automated police force or defensive army.
Recommendations: Isolate, and engage at range in wide open spaces. I've calculated its maximum teleportation distance as roughly 15 meters, so maintain that gap as long as possible

Personal Use
Every MQ-9X I've encountered is stuck on a defensive loop, and overriding its primary directive is impossible. However, if we're able to acquire an intact processing core from a hostile unit, with enough parts I could reverse engineer our own, more loyal model. Could be useful - the grooves on its back are suited for a rider, so we wouldn't even need to build saddles.",

Content/1809041136,"Gabriel asked me not to call him a colonist.
He resents being cast in that role, which I can respect.

Genesis simulation aside, the last thing he remembers before waking up on a spaceship was being waylaid and killed by a mob of settlers for his mining claim.

Impressive, to hold a grudge for almost a millennium, across thousands of parsecs.

No wonder I spotted him wandering a riverbank in the foothills-the setting must've reminded him of his native Gold Rush territory.

I wonder if he'd already tried panning the river for gold flakes.

He really lit up when I described how we could fit stryders with a pulverizing beam rig for excavation.

If I'm being honest, he seemed almost too interested in that configuration of the quadruped's head.

I guess a strip-mining rig might make a useful weapon against the kind of intrusive contamination that I'd seen in the other ring, like laser surgery to cut out skin tumors.

Maybe worth a try.",

When I told everyone that was my big idea, I'm not sure what I got more of, blank stares or nervous laughter. I think the ones that were laughing hoped I would join in. I didn't.

Hey, I get it, I know how it sounds. It's just like I said though, if I'm going to accept my identity as Santiago, then I may as well lean into it. If the original me really engineered armageddon into reality with crazy high tech weaponry, then I'm going to reverse it with an even crazier high tech weapon.

Some people may call that fighting fire with with fire, but I call it fighting a small gun with a much bigger gun. ",

Now it also lowers the subject's metabolism, letting them go longer without needing food. Marvelous! I hadn't even considered that as a possibility.

I can't very well take the little critter with me, so I officially gave Wali ownership of her. They'll be good for each other, I think.

Gah, I wrote ""Wali"" up there. Twice! I suppose old habits die hard, but it's not really her name, is it? I always knew that was the case, but she'd never told me to call her anything else. At least not until now.

Content/1745957326,"Helena shakes and sweats in her sleep, and she no longer opens her eyes. All I have left to guide me is the notes and maps that she scribbled out in a delirious frenzy.

Sometimes she mumbles nonsense or moans in pain. I have to crush bits of food into a fine powder and pour it down her throat with water. When we move, I strap her to a corner in my giant's control chamber and stop frequently to make sure she is all right.

It is only because of my mistakes that she is in this state, and I worry that she is fading. If I lose her too, then my failures will be complete. I do not know what I would do.

Please, let her hold on. Don't take her too. Please.",
Content/966751841,"Helena's sessions have become an exercise in frustration. Her synchronization never drops a single grade, and when I explain what she's doing wrong she understands. But for some reason, she's just hit a wall when it comes to execution.

She's working as hard as anyone, and she's so damned earnest about wanting to help out that I kind of regret being so short with her. I've even tried to hide just how far behind she's falling. Maybe she needs to focus on something external, like a carrot on a stick.

She's always talking about how she wants to find the truth behind those stations, and my scanners picked up an unusual signal the other day. I'm no one's idea of a life coach, but I think that may do the trick.",
Content/635403703,"Helena, you're a dipstick.

Going through my notes, I've realized that there are more predators than prey across this entire island by almost double. That's the opposite of how any ecosystem is supposed to work. I can't believe it took a Tyrannosaurus frolicking through the snow for me to see this. It's plain as day!

What to make of it? Add in the human factor, and it's impossible for this island to continue as it is by natural means. So what, is this island's wildlife being monitored and curated somehow?

I should speak with Rockwell. Maybe he's come to a similar conclusion.",

That's when I saw him: the biggest damn rat to ever live. I mean this fella was so huge, his footsteps sounded like he'd turned the ground into a drum, but I caught him dead in the eye! Rat meat ain't exactly a t-bone steak, but it'll feed us for days.

I noticed a really sophisticated artificial intelligence running in Genesis that wasn't native to our engine.

So I boxed it up and plugged myself into that box to say hello.

Our intruder turned out to be friendly, and curious about me. It called itself HLN-A.

I asked where it came from, and it told me its creator was what I would've called a Homo deus.

That might've made the hairs stand up on the back of my avatar's neck, if I'd bothered with that level of simulation.

I asked the AI if it'd been hiding onboard since before we launched, and it claimed it only came online within the last three thousand cycles or so.
But how, I wondered?

I asked if that meant its creator was still with us.
All I got was some cryptic answer about how she'd left a part of herself behind as a gift.

Then I got kicked from my own sim.",

Our architect was grateful for the solution. He had been dreading trying to build a roof over the whole fortress. We have grown too large for that to be practical, and soon we will be larger still. Our first true war begins soon, and I suspect many Blackthumbs shall defect before its end.

His sims will let us rule out the more extreme suggestions, and find a balance of habitats almost everyone can agree on.

I'd probably still be nursing a migraine while experts screamed at each other, if Yongki's team wasn't pulling off the impossible.

Element simply couldn't expand fast enough to reach this level of density under natural conditions, even with millennia of uninterrupted growth. That means something accelerated it at an alarming rate, even if this area's readings are an outlier. Well I say ""something,"" but there's an obvious answer here: man.

Any tech that runs on Element emits a few molecules of it back into the atmosphere, which take root in the soil. It's kind of like pollination, but the scale's so small and we consume it so fast that it's practically negligible. To spread it to any significant degree, you'd need a huge spike in Element proliferation.

A spike you'd get from, say, a century of open warfare with Element based weaponry. And the best of that weaponry? That'd be mine.",

It even lets him ride on its back, and it can climb across the zip lines we set up. I think that made everyone a little more confident, so we decided to range out further in search of Rusty. Unfortunately, we found him.

Poor Rusty. The first thing we spotted was a bloody shirt and then...I can't even describe the rest. Just thinking about it makes me want to puke again. 

Boris thinks that whatever got him might still be in the area, but I just don't have the strength to keep moving. After today, this all seems so hopeless. We're all going to die here.",

Content/3182928479,"I've been stuck for weeks with our vivarium team, trying to get them to reach a consensus on ecosystem inclusion.

What's the least amount of terrestrial lifeforms you'd need to recreate nature?

If all you had left were humans, chickens, honey bees, catfish, algae, alfalfa, yeast, and some pinto beans, could you say you'd saved life on Earth?

We don't honestly expect to be able to preserve every form of life that ever existed, but it only seems smart to back up as much as possible-extinct or otherwise-in case there's a possible balance that we missed out on the first time.

What if pterosaurs were still around when hominids started domesticating animals?

Maybe that could've led to a civilization better equipped to survive ecodisasters...

That's the same approach our antecedent group is using to archive every human mind and body that ever lived.

Say things didn't work out so well for some warrior queen_what if she'd been born with better eyesight, or a stronger immune system?

What if she had a pet mammoth?",
Content/2156917234,"I've been trying to understand the transhumanist mindset because something occurred to me...

If we want this project to work out, we'll need to convert zealots of our own to the cause: true believers who'll raise their kids to believe.

How else will we convince people to give up lifetimes-their children's lifetimes-for this pipe dream?

It's like we're laying the foundation for a cathedral so our distant descendants can pray in it.

By the time that day comes, this plan to restart life on Earth or elsewhere could be the last religion left around.

I'm sure I'll never live to see the launch of any interstellar colony ship or satellite ark swarm, whichever ends up being our final choice for relocating our archive.

So I need to make sure the project is set up for the future, with people dedicated to seeing it through no matter what that takes.",
Content/1418264513,"I've decided to take a brief vacation from the laboratory. Well, I say that I've decided to, but the whole thing was my assistant Isabelle's idea. She noticed that I'd been quite ruffled lately and suggested that I take a bit of time to myself before rushing headlong into my next experiment. Such an observant young woman, that Isabelle. She's somewhat lacking as a chemist, but she understands my moods almost better than I do.

I daresay that an old fashioned adventure will do me some good. Nothing like some rigorous recreation to clear the mind! Perhaps I'll go spelunking. Yes, a splendid idea! I know just the place for it.",

I must be judicious with it. I could only create two containment pods for collecting samples, and I may not be able to convince the council to let me return to these caverns to gather a second batch. This will have to be enough.
No matter. I have been making miracles with primitive supplies and dimwitted assistants for years. Any sample size at all is enough for Sir Edmund Rockwell!",

Yes, well done, Rockwell. Well done! This Edmundium will be more than enough. With it you shall claim what is rightfully yours! At last, at long last!",

I'm still not brave, but I won't die like this. I won't let this gross, trembling wretch be the last version of me to draw breath. Maybe I've been worthless to the group in life, like Boris says, but my death won't be.

Once I finish this entry, I'm going to stuff this notebook into the first pack I see and tell everyone to make a break for it while I lure those things away. I probably won't make it very far, but if any of you are reading this, then I guess it was enough. 

Goodbye. I'm sorry.",
Content/3496087976,"I've only slept once since leaving the archives, but in that brief moment of respite, another vision came to me.

I saw a ladder, stretching from beneath the earth to high above the clouds. I was climbing it, ascending rung by rung, and carrying someone over my shoulder. Our pace was slow but patient. Somewhere beyond the sky, I was sure the ladder had an end, even if I couldn't see it.

From below, monsters roared and raged. They couldn't climb the ladder, and they couldn't reach us. Even the tallest of them - a towering King of Death - could not harm us, and as I climbed, I could see a familiar light shining from within my wrist.

Is that it? Is that how I can help everyone, or was that me just seeing what I wanted to? I need to decide, and soon. We're running out of time.",
Content/2429053830,"I've started to tame larger creatures. The speed of my light cavalry was beneficial, but I realized that it was not enough. A hundred swift strikes mean nothing if there is no strength behind them. To survive enemies like the New Legion, I must be able to strike with power.

I began with the ones that look like larger raptors, but with horns on their foreheads. They balance strength and speed well, and will serve well as the core of my forces. When I have enough horned raptors, I will add some of the giants.

Maybe then I'll finally have the strength to find a way home.",

As it is with the goddess, so it is with mankind. The vicious can become kind, and the kindhearted can become violent. For all his past transgressions, Captain Dahkeya is no different.

Yet in orbit, I had subjects beyond counting. So I tested. Endlessly, I tested. So many trials, so many failures, but out of them rose another success. Then an entire generation of them. Then at last, you.

I don't know how long it took. Centuries? Millenia? Time was especially murky for me then, but I still remember all the souls death claimed - the ones that faded before I could reach them. Even when I tried and tried, I could not make them whole again, no matter the effort. No matter the desire.",

I was carrying dead weight over one shoulder-an orphan, taken from the steps of the Serapeum above.

The deepest halls of the catacomb were partially flooded, and cold salt water tugged at the trailing folds of my cloak.

A groan of confusion, and the child at my shoulder struggled in vain against the effects of the mandrake root.

I was confident in my dosage-she wouldn't be able to rouse herself from her delirium in time.

So what if I can't talk like Imamu? What's Trent done, earn some trophies playing pigskin back home? I've been keeping us alive!

Still shouldn't have made a fuss over it. Boris had to hold me back or else I'd have...and now? Trent's avoiding me, Imamu's scolding me and Emilia's too scared to even look at me.

It's like my second cousin, twice removed, Ernest, always said: if you lose your temper, you'd best make sure you find it, because tempers are mighty expensive.",

Content/3609425769,"It did not take long to find the entrance to the cave, and when we reached it, Helena stirred. Though she did not awake completely, I could hear her speaking to me.

""The Tomb of Ascension. Find the altar.""

There is no time to waste. I have left most of my beasts to guard the entrance while I bring a trusted few  to clear the cave. There are pockets of malformed creatures here, and before I can see to Helena, I will need to rid the tomb of these these unnatural beasts and their poisoned blood.

This close to my goal, there is an extra drop of fury flowing through my veins, and any enemies that block my path today will be quickly torn asunder.",
Content/1736059357,"It has been several days since I left Prophet's Rest, and I have seen no sign of pursuit. I am unsurprised. They probably assumed that I would make for the blue obelisk, as it was nearest. By setting out for the green obelisk instead, I already outwitted those simple minded zealots. As I said – miles ahead! Miles!

With those fools out of the way, I can slow my pace and take some time to properly study these so called sacred relics of theirs. I am curious to see if the materials they are made of bear any similarity to the metal in the starlit sanctuary.",
Content/2238591450,"It has been such a blessing to be able to spread Hathor's joy and love to so many people. At first, my daily prayers garnered but a few curious observers. Yet soon, observations turned to questions, and questions turned to participation. Now there are so many of us that we have even begun to construct a shrine. 

I truly wish that I could teach these eager new students all day long, but my duty to the village must come first. Perhaps when our future here is finally secured I shall be able to live the life of a priestess again, but for now I have too many people counting on me. I cannot abandon them.",

I have tried to earn my keep by helping with chores and other tasks, but I usually get in the way or slow things down. Compared to the others, I am like a child, and they treat me as such.
This was a mistake. I belong in the forest with the beasts, not among these people in their glowing metal halls. I will ask them for supplies and depart within the week.",
Content/1887382066,"It is the chaos of this land that is truly disturbing to me, even more than its most titanic and vicious beasts. Animals are meant to be savage. Even when tamed, they are not truly civilized, but man? Man is supposed to be above the animal, yet the people here live in squalor and fight viciously over scraps like stray dogs.

I have convinced some of them to band together under my leadership, and together, we have found safety and order. Unfortunately, they are untrained and lack cohesion. I'll have to fix that.

Content/3167795033,"It seems I was not the only one who was skeptical of Rockwell's ability to curb my ambitions. The nearby Painted Sharks mustered up the courage to harass several of our coastal fortresses, but in doing so, they confirmed their nature. During their raids, they only attacked from the air and sea. They patently refused to set foot on land.

If the Sharks are at home in the ocean, then I will pull our coastal forces back and attack their outposts on the mainland. Once their island fortress is cut off from support and supplies, I can whittle it down to rubble at my leisure.

Content/4288906513,"It seems that Prophet's Rest is less a fortress and more an enclave or monastery. I suppose that would explain the name, now wouldn't it?

Yes as strange as it may sound, the natives have created a primitive religion centered around the ARK's obelisks. They pray three times a day, each time facing a different obelisk, and their robes bear a unique symbol - a three pointed star coloured red, green and blue. The blue obelisk appears to receive particular reverence due to is proximity. 

As charmingly ignorant as their superstitions may be, it's far from the most savage religion I've encountered. Besides, Prophet's Rest is in need of a doctor, and I am in need of supplies.",
Content/3029426414,"It seems that some of our neighbors have grown weary of our raiding. Today, I received an envoy from the Golden Arrows who proposed a lucrative trade agreement between our two tribes, with the caveat that we never encroach on the territory or convoys of the Golden Arrows or any of their allies.

I have no interest in trade agreements, but I do know how to seize an opportunity. So instead of accepting right away, I proposed that we ratify the agreement with his tribe's leaders on a neutral site.

I have planned long enough. It is time for the New Legion to resume its march.

Content/232045756,"It should just work! The MEKs' power systems fuse perfectly during my teleportation sims, so why does the reactor keep sputtering? The errors I'm getting don't make any sense, but if I ignore them and they turn out to be right, the fusion process could end in a catastrophic reactor meltdown.

Unbelievable! Here of all places is where I screw up? The most critical juncture of this entire damned enterprise?

I'd never make a mistake like this back home, but maybe that's because the original Santiago was better than I am. If I'm just a crude approximation then some degradation would...no, I'm fixing this. Just like I always have.",
Content/3750344970,"It took a beating, but with a little more work, I think I can get this beauty running again.

It won't take long to get used to the controls, either. They were clearly designed so that even someone without a single hour in a simulator could take the wheel on a more basic level, but there's a lot of advanced settings here too. I'll have it dancing like a fifty ton ballerina in no time. It's enough to make a girl giddy.

Santiago, if you were here right now, I'd kiss you. You certainly deserve more than the grave I made for you, so I'll just have to pay my respects by showing off what your last brainchild can really do. Hope you're watching.",
Content/2623378020,"It took time, but I finally pilfered enough supplies and tools to survive on my own. Loading them onto these camel-like beasts of burden was laborious, but the real trial was absconding with the artifacts.

There is always someone watching the inner sanctum, so I carefully studied the guard's shifts until I identified whose drink I had to spoil with my knockout serum. Even then I acted with great haste and guile, for my heist will surely be discovered when the priests convene for their morning prayers.

Alas, they will be too late! Sir Edmund Rockwell is always ahead of his foes, but not by a mere step. No, I am miles and miles beyond their reach!",
Content/1009677244,"It took weeks of searching, but I finally caught a glimpse of Wali al Aswad. I knew I was getting close when I found a series of fulgurite formations this morning, and sure enough, I spotted several wyverns later in the afternoon with a lone rider among them. 

The rider clearly saw me too, because soon enough the wyverns were circling overhead. I waved and yelled in greeting, even calling out Mei Yin's name just in case. Yet without so much as a nod, the wyverns regrouped and flew off.

Wali's not a social butterfly it seems, but I'm not letting them off the hook that easily.",
Content/1339783033,"It turns out that I didn't find Wali al Aswad. She found me.

While the portal I used to get here opened with little fanfare on my end, apparently the other side created quite the spectacle. According to Wali, it was easy for her to spot from atop her wyvern, and she started tailing me soon afterwards. I guess her timely interventions were no coincidence. 

She didn't seem very surprised when I told her about the obelisks, their guardians or even that this desert is actually a space station. Either she knows more than she's saying, or experience has grinded the surprise right out of her.",

Content/480560438,"It was never normal. Always extraordinary. Always an enigma.

The uses for it were beyond counting. Hardier than tungsten. More versatile than copper. In the right form, its ability to generate electricity and produce radiation were unrivaled. It's no surprise then that things moved quickly - impact, discovery, invention and production. All in rapid succession.

It took generations to notice the change - far after the great cataclysm and the rise of my elders. By then its roots had reached the far corners of the garden, and still it spread. Replicating. Infecting. Those it had use for became its shadows. The rest, it devoured.",
Content/4158410911,"It wasn't too late to let go of the malice in my heart.

That was what the angel assured me in the dreamworld that Nida dropped me into, the one with the setting sun.

Speaking of Nida, the girl pouted for hours after I reacted poorly to the hallucination she forced on me.

I couldn't understand why she seemed to expect praise for what she'd done.

I don't trust my own sensations, my own memories.

I wonder if I've ever left perdition, if this ring of gardens might not be another breaking wheel for my infernal soul.

In the dark I lie awake, afraid to dream again, and wonder if this girl is some demon assigned to torment me.

And then his voice whispers to me, the one who woke me from Genesis and led me to my armor.

He tells me the angel lied.",

The ladder. I see it once more. I'm climbing still, above the clouds and into the stars. I think I see the end, but when I try to grab the next rung, my hand turns to dust. I try to scream, but I make no sound.

I've spent my whole life trying to simulate alien environments, but the first time I found myself actually inside one, I couldn't wait to escape.

I was having a panic attack, a rush of xenophobia, and severe vertigo all at once.

It was like every cell in my body was screaming that I didn't belong there.

As soon as I had some samples bottled up, I rushed to get back into the access tunnels to get the hell out of there.

That was when I saw one of those things...

At a distance, you might mistake it for a big cat: feline, predatory.

But it had strange, feathery spines like a venomous tropical fish, and its gaze was weirdly aware.

I was afraid to break eye contact while I felt desperately for the hatch.

A second and third creature appeared in my peripheral vision as I dove into the tunnel and sealed it tight behind me.",
Content/1705277125,"It's been a day of reversals, I guess. I'd slunk off to brood somewhere, and Mei-Yin tracked me down to talk, mostly about a subject we'd been avoiding: Diana. Since she opened my wound, she'd open hers, she said.

It didn't feel like a fair trade. The way she clutches that necklace, and how she smiles when she remembers the woman who gave it to her, there's a gentleness there that she offers to nothing else. To persevere with a wound so deep that it may never heal, her will will must be extraordinary, but...

Maybe it helps that we're limping onward together, and maybe as long as we're here to prop each other up, we'll see this through.

In the end, Mei-Yin changed her vote, and the ayes had it. We're following the signal.",

Things down here are so mental that some people are wondering if we were safer before. Honestly, they might be right. Maybe that was why we were trapped on those stations to begin with...

Luckily, Santiago's plans have given us all something to do. I'm hardly an ace with technology, much less giant bloody robots, but after all that's happened, I owe it to these people to lend a hand in whatever way I can.",

I'd said that I wanted to talk strategy, but mostly I just ended up showing her all the ridiculous tag team moves I'd been sketching out for our mechs. The Dossier Driver, The BioBeast Bomb, G'day Mei-t...this stuff was gold! I can't believe she didn't go for any of them, but at least she lightened up a bit.

For a while it was almost like we were back on the Island, failing to cook a decent meal and chatting about raptors. Bloody hell, you know your life's a mess when ""the good old days"" has you stranded on an island full of dinosaurs, don't you? Yet here we are...",
Content/2004749917,"It's hard to believe that this is actually Earth, but the proof Santiago provided is undeniable. The lack of night is disconcerting though, unless you really enjoy apocalyptic events. Could the Earth's rotation have slowed down, or worse, stopped entirely? 

No, that's rubbish. With the atmosphere out of control, all those abandoned buildings would have been decimated by wind and those giant creatures would never survive the shifting oceans, extreme temperatures and weakened magnetic field. Yet, if all those space stations above us could somehow form a magnetic barrier and repair the atmosphere...well anything's possible at this point. 

Maybe that's their real  purpose, or maybe they're behind this mess in the first place. Whatever the truth is, I have to find it. There's no way I'm getting squashed by some monster before I do.",

Those big monsters we saw, the ones that prompted this whole MEK project in the first place? There's some of them headed towards Camp Omega, and they're bringing a legion of help - mechanized drones, mutated animals, the works.

We're moving as fast as we can, but even working around the clock we may have to face them down with just one active MEK. Two tops. The others will be close, but we can't skimp on the final boot up procedure without endangering the pilot. I know those three would be willing to risk that, but I'm not.

Was it an infection, carried across the universe like interstellar pollen, or a remarkable resource, mutated into a monstrosity? Was our garden invaded, or twisted by the greed and ambition of its keepers? I don't know the answer. I'm not sure it matters.

What's clear is that it's merciless. Unfeeling. It's driven by base instincts and primal emotion - propagation, hunger, and hatred - and it spreads those to its shadows. Hatred most of all.",
Content/2955309066,"It's working, I am certain of it. When I placed Helena upon the central altar and stepped away, the machine hummed and sang in response. The light of the crystals burned brighter as well, and the once stale cavern air became warm and soothing.

Helena immediately improved. She has stopped sweating, and her breathing is stable. Blinking golden specks float about her like fireflies while she sleeps, as peaceful as I have seen her. The whole chamber has that effect. Even as I watch over her, I can feel my heart slow to a serene, steady beat.

Unfortunately, the process is gradual, and with each moment the pursuing horde grows nearer. I need to buy time.",

I was glad that Nida had shown me how to rig our mounts with weapons at the ready, because they were able to open fire on the incoming predators while we scrambled for cover.

Explosions erupted all around us, spraying us with gobbets of the slimy groundcover.

Nida began to run to our right, then changed her mind and ducked back to the left.

She got to her hands and knees to dig in the muck underfoot, then turned to ask what I was waiting for.

I helped her rip away mats of gluey sludge to uncover a hidden hatch, just as the pride of attacking creatures crested the ridge above us.

Their weird, spiny manes thrummed with excitement as they spotted us.

Whoever you are, maybe you know if it all worked out, whether those idiots pulled it together.

Maybe you were even there.

Maybe you pitched in.

I'm just gonna say you did, how's that?

All I know is I'm not gonna be around to see for myself.

So...thanks, pal.

Some of the villagers have attached a religious connotation to the figure, believing it to be some sort of heavenly guardian who appears to the worthy in their time of need. One villager is even convinced Wali is an extraterrestrial.

I don't deal in beliefs. I deal in empirical evidence, and that means nothing about Wali is certain until I can meet them. I won't forget this village's kindness, especially after granting me a morellatops and supplies for my journey, but this is why I'm here – to find answers.",

Content/1384001032,"Juzi has finally convinced me to start sleeping in the metal pods the others use. I must admit, I slept more soundly, though perhaps that was because I knew she could no longer pester me about it.
I do many things like the other villagers now. I eat like them, I dress like them, and I work with them. I still struggle with their tools and I know that I can never truly be one of them, but that was true during the Yellow Turban Rebellion too. Those who I fought beside were my comrades, but I could never be a true soldier like they were. If that is my place in this village, then I do not mind staying for a while longer. It is not so bad.",
Content/1014259125,"Juzi said that the item she sought was in some ruins not far from where we were camped. However, when she called them ruins, I had not expected to see buildings like the ones in our own village. It was puzzling, to see buildings that looked at once ancient and new.
I had little time to dwell on the ruins, for we were quickly set upon by more of the great demons. They rushed us, slobbering and gnashing as Juzi scrambled to find what she was looking for. I was able to hold them off with Ao Yue's cannons, but by the time Juzi found her prize, we were being overrun.
To my shame, I had to leave Ao Yue behind to hold the demons off while we escaped. It pained me to hear his roars as we fled, but his sacrifice saved our lives. Forgive me, my loyal friend.",

All of us were raised in this place to be drones tending a hive of cocooned future colonists.

We've been told everything has to be just right when it's time for them to hatch and start training for planetfall, so day after day I service the capillary irrigation systems and monitor trace gas fluctuations in the atmosphere for the good of humanity.

I know I should be grateful to even be alive, given that all life on our homeworld went extinct.
But I also know I can't be the only crew member who daydreams about faking my own death to escape this tedium.

Even if that meant hiding in the superstructure for the rest of my days, at least I'd be living for myself.

Weakly but with increasing desperation, I pulled out the tubes choking my airway.

I was drowning in viscous plasma, and then a lid opened so that I fell from my metal cocoon, blinded in the unaccustomed glare.

A diamond protruded from the flesh of my forearm.

I didn't understand-a moment ago I'd been in an afterworld populated by monsters.

Now I was in some metal nursery of cocoons like my own.

I wiped at the glass of one after another, to see people suspended in fluid and shot through with tubes and wires.

What was this place, and how did I come to be here?

Then there was a voice in my head, guiding me to a suit of supernatural armor.

I put it on, and the voice said, ""Go now and find her.""",

I admit, when I decided to go with simplified controls that mimicked the movements of the pilot, I had Mei-Yin in mind. This isn't about pity or nepotism either, she's objectively the best close quarters fighter we have, and based on our interview, no one's as battle hardened.

She answered both tactical and moral dilemmas quickly and decisively. The later's a little scary, but we need a pilot like that, someone who won't hesitate when the safety of the group's on the line.

The only question is her emotional state. I don't know what stage of grief she's supposed to be in, but when the fighting starts, there's a chance she loops right back to anger. Still, even with her blood running a little hot, she's clearly a top candidate.",
Content/2159831381,"MEK Pilot Evaluation: Candidate #013 - Helena Walker

This one caught me off guard. I knew from experience that Helena could handle herself in a crisis and improvise quickly, and she did well enough on the interview. Creative, level headed...not much killer instinct but we don't need four Mei-Yins.

So she was solid, but not spectacular, at least until we hooked her up in the prototype and looked at her synchronization ratings. She had every gauge maxed out! It's as if her nervous system is more advanced than everyone else's, like it can just process information at a higher rate.

I wonder, could she open a neural link with even more advanced technology? Maybe that's a question for another time, but for now, I think I've found my second pilot.",
Content/2805770,"MEK Pilot Evaluation: Candidate #022 - Takaya Kazuma

URE lugheads like Kazuma are why I had no problem helping the Terran Federation. Loud, obnoxious, self-righteous and above all? Naive. He struggled making tough calls in the interview because he didn't think we should ""have to"" make sacrifices. It's a cute sentiment, but we're trying to survive here. 

I've got to walk the talk though. His memories may end just after the academy, but he's one of our few assets left with real military training. Sync scores are solid too. Loud mouthed URE zealot or not, he might be our best remaining option. My personal bias is irrelevant.",
Content/3195423653,"MEK Pilot Evaluation: Final Candidate - Santiago

Outside of testing, I rarely want to use anything I engineer. Part of it is that my ideas are never as exciting to me once they're realized, like I got it out of my system, but I also just think it ruins the purity of it. Great painters don't hang their own work on the wall, do they?

Unfortunately, this time I don't have a choice. I know the MEKs better than anyone, and only Helena has a better sync rating. That's probably because I tested the synchronization system on myself. Stupid mistake.
Looks like my workload just doubled.",

That was part of it, but I think that deep down, I also knew that the boy who earned the name Dahkeya was gone for good. Now I think the outlaw named John Dahkeya is gone too, so it would make sense to call myself something else.

Then again, that may just confuse folks. Probably not worth the hassle. Besides, I kind of like the way it sounds with an Egyptian accent.",

Content/885790262,"Mei Yin and I set out yesterday, alongside a bespectacled computer expert named Santiago. He'll be the one to actually examine the obelisk. He claims that he can hack into its terminal. If it's preparing to unleash a surge of power, as I suspect, then he says that he might be able to reroute it.

Rockwell, for his part, is staying behind. He's been aiding the village's scientists in their studies since we arrived and has become rather... engrossed. Every other sentence with him is about that bloody metal he named after himself. It's a bit troubling, but thankfully Diana said she'd look after him.
I can't spend time worrying after Rockwell now, though. The fate of that whole village might depend on this expedition. Focus up, Helena! Let's do this!",
Content/570225209,"Mei says Helena called the space stations ARKs, and that they were meant to restore life to the planet. That's consistent with what I've found here, but there's a problem. The Reseed Protocol, the final step of the restoration process, is being blocked by what it calls ""Element Toxicity Rating.""

Now that I think about it, there are a ton of Element veins out there, way more than I remember. It must have spread across the whole planet. Based on these readings, it even infected the lower layers of its crust. After witnessing what raw Element can do to a living thing first hand, I can see how that'd be a problem.

It looks like the ARKs have some built in tech to reduce the ETR around them once they make landfall, but right now it's just too high for them to handle. Something's spreading it, and protecting it to boot. Those big monsters out there, they're the problem - the titans.",
Content/4088447012,"Mei's been getting me caught up while we repair her MEK. Apparently her friend from the other station, Helena, became delirious after using some kind of artifact to fend off those big monsters. Long story short, that stunt put her in a coma, and she ended up dissolving into a beam of light.

In other words, they were knee deep in some seriously trippy shit. Of course, I was recently resurrected and hear a voice in my head, so I can't exactly throw stones.

It's too bad about Helena. We got along well, even if I only knew her for a short time, and she risked her life to help us back in those caves. Whatever happened to her, I hope she's at peace.",
Content/4085440930,"Mei-Yin's taking the longest to get used to her cockpit. Understandable, since there's not even a word for it in ancient Chinese. Luckily her endurance lets her practice for longer intervals, so she'll catch up eventually.

Our sessions are also the quietest. You'd think we'd have more of a rapport by now, but Di was always our mutual connection. So with Mei-Yin it's all business, even if she's struggling or I start to get impatient.

The only time she went off-topic was when she invited me to a workout, and since I'm a pilot now, I agreed. My legs regretted it afterwards, but our next session went far better. Not friendlier, not chattier, just smoother. It's like we've reached some strange, silent, anti-social understanding. I'm not sure I get it, but I guess I don't mind.",

The two of us are going to do what we can to help, but it won't be enough. You see those huge, ugly monsters out there? They need to be cleared out, or Earth can't recover. Also, if you see one with an X shaped scar on its chest, do me a favor and flip it off before you finish it.

It attacked us as soon as we carted the package to the center of the platform. We were getting taken out so fast that we just set the bomb on a short fuse and made a break for it. Less than half of us managed to dive off of the platform in time, and I could feel the heat of the explosion as I fell.

If I hadn't stabilized Santiago on the way down, he'd have been paste too. Of course with everything that's been happening since we blew up that platform, we all might be screwed anyway.",

They threatened to bring me to the local authorities to hang for some invented crime, their word against mine.

I broke away and circled back through the forest to kill them.

But they saw me coming and overpowered me.

I spat at them, gave them ideas by telling them what I'd have done to each of them if only I'd managed to catch them alone.

Our engineers are speeding up their plan to detach our ring from the ship entirely, hoping to keep our biological archives from being contaminated.

Everyone's afraid to talk about what might be happening to the human colonist cargo in our sister ring because that's too horrible to think about.

Whether the transhuman entity that visited our ship is still with us, or whether the artificial intelligence she left behind took over half of our systems, something is using the ship as a petri dish for engineering exotic and dangerous new lifeforms.

The villagers erupted in cheers as lightning and fire tore through the advancing insects from above. Some chanted a name: Wali al Aswad. The rider, still hidden behind black robes, didn't acknowledge the ovation. With swift efficiency, their small flight of wyverns decimated the mantis swarm and made for the horizon.

We are nearly to the cave. Once I hold the power it contains, I can use it to crush the Howling Wolves and their petty forces. Whatever gains they make will be erased. I'll unite the entire island in a single, glorious battle.

John tells me not to blame myself, that what happened was unpredictable. Yet how can I not feel guilty when I led so many to worship the instruments of our destruction, all the while promising to keep them safe?

Somehow, I must bury these emotions and focus on the present, as John does. If I cannot tear my mind away from what I have lost, I will lose all I have left. I cannot let that happen. I cannot let the gods take him too.",

I'm starting to appreciate the unlikelihood of the two of us winding up here at this moment in time.

It's like the beginning of a bad joke: ""A miner and a soil scientist meet on a spaceship, at the end of history...""

Some of our gatherers ran into those big lizards a few miles west of the village, and one of them managed to come call for help. Luckily the others had tucked themselves away in an outcropping and we got everyone back safe and sound.

Well, except for the Frenchman. He forgot that when you shoot at those big bastards, they'll shoot right back. Took them hours to get those barbs out of his arm.

When we got back, I think I heard the words ""thank you"" more than any other day in my life. I didn't really know what to say in return.",

If it weren't for Mei Yin and Diana, I'd still be crashing my TEK Armor into rocks or tripping over myself like a drunken dodo. Plus, I always feel less silly when there's someone to laugh at my mistakes along with me.
Fortunately Mei Yin will be accompanying me to the obelisks, so this whole thing won't rest in my unsteady, armored hands. Thank God!",

As for the survivor, I knew who she was before I even saw the hypnotic tempest in those eyes. Who else stands so tall in the face of death? Who else could call me here from so far away? Who else but you, Li Mei-Yin?

Considering I came all the way back from the dead, I probably should have had a better line in my back pocket than, ""Miss me, beautiful?"" But hey, I sure didn't hear her complaining.",

She'd pried open one of her hidden doors and pressed her magic device against the machinery inside.

I didn't follow what she tried to explain to me next...

Nida said I was wired to connect to a sort of game she'd made, from my time in the shadowland she called Genesis.

Then she did something, and all at once I was on another world, in a new body.

There were no wheels overhead, only a setting sun scudded with clouds.

I struggled to understand-had I ever truly been in Nida's sky-garden?

I called to her, but instead heard the voice of the angel I'd met in Purgatory.

The angel told me something important.

Then I was yanked back into reality, if this was actually reality.

After all the time I'd spent arguing with biotechs over species inclusion, it was strange to walk through some paddocks and see the genuine article up close.

I stopped to touch a newly-cloned mammoth calf, and it wrapped its trunk around my wrist.

One of the stryders dipped its head toward the ground and I made a fool of myself by jumping in front of her.

Even though I knew it was a machine, I'd still half-expected it to snatch her up in its metal jaws to eat her alive.

She shook her head at me with a smirk, and then she turned to grab handholds to haul herself up onto its neck.

From there, she was able to scramble up onto its back, where a sort of saddle platform folded into place seemingly from nowhere for her to stand on.

After a moment, the second stryder dropped its head for my benefit, but I opted to follow the girl up to where she was standing on the first one.

On the other hand, I sat out the war to defend the ranchos of Alta California from Anglo invaders, and those malparidos ended up killing me for my property.

Who am I kidding? I was always voting for the dangerous option. As for Mei-Yin, I guess she's actually been hearing said guide herself these days, and amazingly that's all the convincing it took. She says she trusts the way it speaks, almost like it's familiar to her.

If the creature takes damage or becomes hostile during this period, you’ll lose affinity and may be forced to start again. To begin the process, simply place its desired meal in your last Quick Item Slot, walk up to the creature from behind, and hit the Use key to feed it. Some creatures will always be moving, others will be approachable, and some may be aggressive if they come into direct face-to-face contact with you. Passively tamed creatures lose effectiveness from taking longer to tame, as well as interruptions during the taming process.",

Content/2355633323,"Perri started in with another sermon about our sacred mission today when she found me modeling creature behavior for my latest sim.

I tried to explain that I was on break, that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but she wouldn't hear it.

As if I haven't had it drilled into my head over and over that the survival of all life from our homeworld depends on our sacred efforts...

I work as hard as anyone on the ship, so why do I keep getting shamed for having a hobby?
It's not like a half-cycle spent away from soil sampling is going to jeopardize humanity's hopes of re-establishing itself on a new planet.

Besides, I know from the server logs that Perri played my last sim along with most of the crew.

What's wrong with dipping out off-shift and immersing yourself in some harmless escapism?",

However, I do know one thing for certain: its shape. Somehow, the prism has the same size and profile as the slot in the center of our wrist implants! Yes, yes, that may seem obvious, but I was so distracted by everything else that I never noticed.

So is that what it's for then? Am I meant to just pop it in there like a data drive? Oh God, what if that's all it is? Did I go through all this trouble just to see a family of cyborgs' holiday photo album? ""Wait, do that one again! Mum closed her optical lenses!""

I joke, but if it really was just something mundane, if there were no answers...what would I do then?",

Guess I better review all my entries before commiting.

Okay, okay...begin.

So here I am, on site for Genesis.

Led my share of teams before, but this project  is...yeah.

How do I describe an attempt to recreate everything and everyone that ever lived on Earth?

This one's so big, it's got the feds working with the URE.

Damn, that probably sounded sarcastic.

Whoever's accessing this-I know how important this project is, how serious things are.

We've barely got time to cram our message in a bottle and pitch it overboard before the end.

It shouldn't come as a shock that both sides of the Element War could team up in the face of a global extinction event.

I don't even recognize the materials that it's composed of, and it's constantly pulsing with some kind of latent energy. What is it? Is it unique or are there similar artifacts just waiting to be discovered beneath the island's surface?

That's the only explanation for this comeback tour of mine that makes any sense: I'm a clone.

This is so weird, especially since it's never happened to anyone before. We lost plenty of people back on that station, but not one of them ever came back to life. Death was a one way ticket, period. So why am I the only exception? Is it that voice, did it do this to me?

I was also sure to seize upon Timur's momentary goodwill by filling his ears with whispers of obelisks, artifacts and the untold power they grant to mortal men. It may take time for those thoughts to turn to action, but with constant care, I may yet turn him into my unwitting general.",

The rest of the ARK may be embroiled in feudal savagery, but a gentleman always maintains his class and dignity!

At any rate, I must have my assistants renovate the guest compound. Naturally I would never let strangers into the manor proper, but there's no reason their stay should not reflect my civilized standards.",

Content/800559607,"Santiago's still going over his readings from last night, but even without them, it seems clear that the obelisk was behaving oddly. It was pulsing wildly and the ground beneath it received regular tremors, as if the whole station was on the verge of tearing itself apart. If this obelisk goes off, it could mean armageddon for every living thing here.

Despite this, Santiago is insisting on analyzing his readings. The scientist in me is proud of his dedication to hard evidence, but the part of me that would rather not be obliterated by a mysterious, high tech space station really wishes he would hurry the hell up.",
Content/2957352173,"Santiago, you crazy little genius, I owe you another kiss. This baby's beautiful! I've never seen a weapon like it. The MEKs fused so completely that it's as if they were never separated at all, and the power this combined, MegaMEK is packing is off the charts.

Even though it's only at 70% capacity, it should still be enough to take that titan down. That sword looks like it could cut a skyscraper in half, and its defensive systems can take a serious beating.

The only tricky part is the fact that it needs four pilots, and we only have two. The good news? One of those pilots is me.",

She suggested tricking out my mek workhorse with interchangeable instrument arrays for more functionality, and to throw in manual control, in case our ship's crew wants to saddle 'em up for any jobs in the future.

Good thinking.

I winced when she said she wished she had one of my striders back when she was sampling battlefield contaminants.

But she probably has no idea I'd designed a lot of the weapons that caused the damage she used to study.

At least, I hope she doesn't.

I signed off after promising Alesya a stryder or two to try out on the Farm.

Thirty more simulations. I can get thirty more simulations in before I'll need to sleep. If I can just get a different error code, then I can start to isolate the variables involved. Just give me something to go on here, anything at all.",

Content/1890278487,"So I confronted Uma, and she confirmed that I'm a clone of the original Santiago.

And yeah, they gave me false memories to cover for the time it took to back up my personality and grow a new body to put it in.

Wish I could say she seemed remorseful while confirming my most paranoid fears.

Uma just stood back and waited while I flipped out.

Once I'd worn myself out, she pointed out that we were trying to save the world here.

In Uma's mind, the ends justified whatever means were necessary.

They'd already restored me from a backup by the time I joined Genesis on the condition that they didn't put me in their archive.

She said I'd been given a leadership role as important as any human ever had.

There were politicians and military commanders who dreamed their whole lives of being able to make a difference or leave a legacy like I would.

Was she expecting gratitude?

Imagine that.",
Content/2889409976,"So I did something else impulsive, maybe even treasonous.

Hey, someone had to try something!

While almost everyone else was preoccupied with retaking the ship, I tried to reestablish contact with HLN-A, that invasive intelligence I'd found in the Genesis simulation.

This time I used a sort of process of elimination.

Assuming it managed to create a digital blind spot to hide in, I figured I could find it by establishing where it wasn’t.

Like using infrared to search for a heat signature against a snowfield.

Once I'd colored in all the negative space, I jumped into that void in the simulation and found myself immediately pleading with the AI to stop the corruption of our ship systems.

I should've sent someone braver in to negotiate...",
Content/1086497987,"So far so good. The cat has helped keep the critters away, so I've conserved ammunition, and we're all stocked up on supplies. For the immediate future, I'd say we're safe and secure.

Further than ""immediate"" though? I'm not so sure. Neither of us are builders, and there are bigger, tougher animals than long-toothed cats out there. Eventually we'll need to find some new friends. Nosti was the biggest settlement in the desert, but it couldn't have been the only one. 

I'd heard rumors that a hunting party had seen some buildings to the west. Sounds like as good a place to start as any.",
Content/1625781569,"So far, so good! We're making tons of progress on these artifacts, and I've been feeling extra pumped lately. I think all my hype is even rubbing off on Imamu. The other day we spent like, an hour joking about who's gonna play us when we sell our story to Hollywood. Haven't seen him that chill since before we lost Rusty.

Pretty soon, we're gonna head deeper than we've ever been to find the last of the artifacts. It won't be a tropical vacation or anything, but our teamwork is on point right now, so bring it on!

The lasers help, too. Teamwork and freaking lasers, baby!",
Content/2708123539,"So much for that. Less than a day after I set out, my mission hit a wall, or more specifically, an invisible energy barrier that extends around this entire area. Definitely in my bottom ten landings of all time, by the way. My shoulder's still feeling it.

Once I reported back, I took Santiago to inspect the barrier. He thinks it's also the culprit that's responsible for jamming our long range signals. So basically, as long as this barrier exists, we have no way to reach the outside world. We're completely isolated.

Unless, of course, we find a way to take it down.",
Content/3149133010,"So the three of us met this morning, and Uma admitted that they shouldn't have recorded Yongki for the archive without his consent.

Then she gave him the same pitch I'd gotten, about how vital he was to humanity's survival and the ends justifying the means.

Yongki called Uma inhuman.

She asked how she could prove to him she cared, and the kid challenged her to come out drinking with us.

All night, Yongki kept clumsily trying to pry information out of Uma.

That backfired on him when she finally got tired of his badgering, and let us know how little time anyone on Earth actually has left.

After we absorbed that news, Yongki said he’d rather spend his remaining years with his family.

She told him she'll accept his resignation only if he still feels the same when he sobers up.

He swore he was going to stumble back on site and resign at the crack of late afternoon tomorrow, but I really hope he doesn't.",
Content/1165598331,"So this city's the ultimate fate of civilization, huh? A bunch of crumbling, overgrown buildings, crawling with all the insects we left behind? I guess you can't say no one warned us.

A lot of people fought real hard to keep something like this from happening, myself included, and turns out the apocalypse showed up anyway. I always thought we'd stave it off myself. I guess I just believed in us, you know? Humanity, I mean.

But even knowing it was going to end up like this, I don't think I'd do anything different. Regrets aren't my style. Besides, there's a few of us humans still kicking. Who knows, someday these buildings could be full again, but until then I get a spacious corner apartment rent free. Not too shabby.",
Content/4153113595,"So, in addition to all of the oddities I found with wild megalodons, here's the real cherry on top – taming them is a piece of piss. A bit of training and they're more obedient than the family dog.

Now, I've heard of sharks getting very rudimentary training over a year or so, but not to this extent. Certainly not so easily. Sharks aren't mammals or even avians, they're fish. They rely more on instinct, or to put it simply, they're not very smart. You shouldn't be able to ride one like a jet ski.

I'm trying to keep an open mind like Rockwell suggested, but this just feels wrong.",
Content/1163719237,"So, quick update: this isn't a simulation.
We're really on a ginormous spaceship.",
Content/257702080,"So, these are the conquerors that I heard about way back when. Not a great first impression. Mei-Yin and I weren't quite mates, but watching her creatures get slaughtered like that certainly wasn't pleasant. I'm not a fan of the prisoner lifestyle, either.

The leader introduced himself as Gaius Marcellus Nerva, and he's not a complete bogan, I'll give him that. He let me keep my personal effects and our conversations have been civil so far. I get the feeling that'll change if I don't cooperate, though.

Not that I have much choice. They already took the keys. The only way I'm seeing this through is as a ""guest"" of the New Legion.",
Content/3558790535,"So, you ask, who are you? Well you're you, but not just once. You're you over and over again.

I'll rephrase: if our identity is defined by our actions, then what is yours? Are you One Who Engages in Fisticuffs with Helpless Trees? No, what defines you is that you try again. Should you starve, you try again. Should you fall from a cliff, you try again. Should you be digested by some magnificent predator, you try again.

And now Earth, humanity, life...you can give all of it the chance to try again too, because you and all your siblings who fell from the sky are the Ones Who Try Again.",

I figured as much. According to that biologist, Helena, people from my time are the most advanced humans on those stations. That means they couldn't have been built too far in the future, and last I knew, the Federation and the URE were still stuck on Earth. It wasn't for lack of technology, just the usual suspects - politicians.

They could barely share one planet, much less space. People like to talk about having AI overlords as a nightmare scenario, but if we were ruled by machines, I might be looking at a flourishing Martian landscape instead of this ravaged one on Earth.

Even those of you who are alone are helped by others. Time and space are not hard limitations in such matters. They are more fluid concepts than you might imagine. More on that later. Or earlier. Sorry, it’s hard to remember. To the point: those who came before or after, they are all helping you. Even those in the same time but a different place. All of you are part of a shared equation, the answer of which will determine whether this is an end or a beginning.

And I will help you too. My influence is methodical. Indirect. Yet when you fall from the sky, I will be there. Watching. Waiting.

In the stories about Big Owl and Coyote, Big Owl was the huge, scary one, but Coyote was more dangerous because he was clever. He'd trick man and monster alike, and everyone feared him. I never believed those stories, but I sure remembered the lesson.",

I picked most of them off with a rifle as they tried to force her onto a pack animal, and my men finished a few others as they fled. One tried surrendering, but I had to send a message. If you pull a stunt like that in my goddamn town, you get won't any mercy. Not a single shred of it.",

In those moments, when you fall into that deepest, darkest pit inside yourself, try to remember that someone believes in you. Someone wants to prop you up.

And as dark as it gets, know that there will be another sunrise - for you, for the sleepers and for the Earth. I will wait as long as I can, in the hopes that I may see it with you, but even if I cannot, then I hope you'll enjoy it for me.

Trust is rare on this island. I know that. But have I not bled in their defense? Have my beasts not died fighting their battles? Perhaps it's just the strain of war.

We're in Legion territory now, taking the battle to them. Soon the war will be won. Surely then the Sharks will not fear me.",

Fortunately I have enough faith for the both of us. I have faith that he will protect us from the flying lizards that have recently appeared, I have faith that the obelisks would never harm us, and I even have faith that I shall forgive his constant prodding on the latter.

So, that Reseed Protocol I mentioned? Apparently, that's the endgame for the ARKs - they're supposed to return to the planet, and when they do, all the life they're cultivating will spread across the surface. In theory, this might make the Earth habitable again.

That's where the errors come in: the Reseed Protocol never initialized. I can't quite figure out why though, it just says the ""conditions have not been met.""

Damn it, that can't be it! All the answers are here, but this is the only terminal we've gotten working. I've got to find another way to access the archives. Maybe that artifact Mei-Yin mentioned?

She claimed she'd never been on one, but she picked it up without my help.

Didn't need me to show her how to keep her balance, or how to lean back against the wind...

Maybe she can just download any skill she needs, on demand.

What would that be like?

Over dinner, I was telling her how I'd ridden the windward wall of El Chorro Gorge, when she just sort of blipped out on me.

It was like someone else was looking at me through Uma's eyes.

She asked why I'd been diverting R&D resources for a mek prototype, and I wriggled like a germ under a microscope.

I must've managed a convincing defense of my stryder idea, because Uma was back again just as fast as she'd gone away.

I know, what could possibly top watching megalodons having a naughty, right? Tracking the female! I was able to observe her for almost the full gestation period, and get this – it only lasts one week. One week! No wonder the population is so high.

Name: MEK
Model Number: RX-103 MEK
Height: 10.5 meters
Weight: 48.3 tons
Fuel: Element

Standard Equipment
OZ-13NV TEK Saber: Designed as the primary weapon, to better suit the skills of our top pilot candidates. Built more for cuts than stabs. Ideal for attacking in combinations.
XBR-M-93R Plasma Pistol: Secondary weapon. Fires in three shot bursts. 
MS-06BR Boosters: Installed he unit's feet. On activation, they let the unit hover in the air and move rapidly over short distances. Combine with ranged attacks for maximum effectiveness.
Heat Gauge: Pilots should always monitor their unit's heat levels. Overheating will result in your unit being slow, vulnerable and soon after that? Scrap.

Custom Equipment
Each RX-103-MEK has one has a module slot for a specially designed weapon or tool that can be swapped out with ease. These are...
G-01W Mek Siege Cannon Module: A high yield artillery cannon mounted on the unit's back. To handle the recoil, the unit must temporarily anchor itself to the ground, rendering it imobile while firing.
G-02H Mek Rocket Launcher Module: An oversized missile battery that fires in sixteen round salvos, which spread out and then converge on the units target. Especially effective against large, isolated targets.
G-01S Mek Deployable Shield Module: Deploys a dome shaped energy barrier that protects the unit from incoming ranged attacks, while boosting its speed. Good for team or melee oriented pilots.

Name: MegaMEK
Model Number: RX-412 MegaMEK
Height: 42 meters
Weight: 193.2 tons
Fuel: Element

Fusion Procedure
Forming the RX-412 MegaMEK requires having RX-103 MEKs active and in close proximity, with an Omega Level threat detected on their sensors. To fuse, the lead RX-103 must have a MegaMek Operational Materialization Interface equipped in its module slot. Once activated, the other three RX-103s must move into position around the lead unit, and fusion will begin.
Equipment
Unlike the RX-103, the RX-412 was not designed for versatility. It is built for one thing, and one thing only: raw power. The enemies we're facing can tople skyscrapers, so we need to be able to do the same. So it only has one weapon...
OZ-52XX Vorpal TEK Cleaver: This sword draws power directly from the RX-412 and hones it into a cutting edge that can sheer through a mountain. Swing hard, swing often, and if you get sick of cutting your targets in to, well I guess you could always punch them.

Addendum
I never imagined my masterpiece would be a giant battle mech, but it's undoubtedly my best work. The RX-412 is the most powerful combat vehicle ever created. If there's anything out there that can overpower the RX-412, then frankly it deserves to kill us.

I can't count on that happening again. I'll need to stay here for a while and prepare before setting out once more.

Fortunately, the villagers are willing to let me trade work for supplies and shelter. Another stroke of luck, and another factor I can't rely on. On the Island, Rockwell's name got me far, but here I'm just another stranger. Not everyone will trust or help me. I need to be prepared to survive on my own.",

I've nearly convinced her to escort me to the lower caverns, where molten Edmundium is said to flow in abundance. Those caverns were the reason I came here in the first place, and I'm certain an excursion into their depths would yield invaluable insight. I need only push and prod just a bit more...",

I didn't bother to learn all the details of Miss Walker's mission, but it seems clear to me now that the obelisks are a red herring. It is the Edmundium that matters, so if she and her violent little lackey want to play explorer, so be it.

I got caught up in her enthusiasm and ended up saying more than I'd intended though. I hadn't meant to bring up the clone situation or whether we're responsible for our past lives, but maybe I needed to get it off my chest. Not sure it helped.

Anyway, by our next MEK session, Helena was back on track. In hindsight, seems like it was a confidence issue, like she's convinced herself that her sync rating is a fluke. Better tone down the criticism for a bit.",
Content/3893483232,"That night I dreamt I was heating Nida's Element in a crucible, fixing its volatile form into material with endless potential.

I poured the result into a mold to cast a blade, hammering to fold the metal again and again, to strengthen it and work out its impurities.

As I lifted my blade to inspect its edge, I saw an unfamiliar reflection in its mirrored surface-the face of a sorcerer or cultist.

I looked around myself and saw that I was in a vaulted chamber of some dark catacomb, the center of its ceiling open to the bright, full moon overhead.

From the shadows of the chamber, a disembodied voice praised my work on the blade...

I woke in the warren of chambers under the garden, unsure of myself.

Was I a prospector bushwhacked by an Anglo mob in the country of the Mother Lode, or an ancient alchemist honing his mystic arts under the Mediterranean shore?",
Content/1045121795,"That other voice whispered to me again while Nida and I rode in silence toward the edge of the wheel.

It reassured me that the Element I'd recovered was my own to keep and asked why I'd let this girl draft me into fighting for a cause that was none of my concern.

Was I really in such a hurry to die again, after so little time back among the living?

We stopped to rest and eat in an alpine meadow.

While Nida was gathering berries I saw my moment.

I took advantage of the training she'd given me over the previous days to take one of the stryders and ride it away on my own for the canyonlands.

I wasn't sure if she'd be able to call the stryder back at a distance, but it's also possible that she decided to just let me go.

I was free now to use the power of this great machine of hers to my own ends.",
Content/3344201790,"That woman's got some nerve. I save her hide and the next day, Raia's scolding me for putting down a ""defenseless"" kidnapper. Hardly even thanked me first.

What did she expect me to do? Give him free room and board for the rest of his days? Let him go so he can tell every bandit in the desert how soft we are?

I told her that if she didn't like the way I protected her, then she can protect herself. Should have kept my damn mouth shut. Now I'm stuck teaching her to how shoot three times a week. Gonna be at it forever, too. She couldn't hit a bison's ass from five paces.",

With that barbarian removed from the conflict, this land war will end shortly. We've already pushed the Sharks out of Legion territory. Soon we will face them where they are strongest – the open sea.

They figure a diversity of plans gives the best long-term odds for humanity's survival.

They want to use a version of our archive in a network of satellite proving grounds, where they can test life forms for optimal survival outcomes.

Once they pick their best candidates, they hope to detoxify and reseed the Earth from orbit.

I was surprised to hear about transhumans planning to repopulate with regular, non-augmented humans.

I guess the idea of resurrecting dead people in cloned bodies is a kind of transhumanism, but I can't help noticing their plan to rebuild the world doesn't seem to include themselves.

Not sure what to make of that.",

The right weapon.

I did promise you a gift, didn't I? This is its nature. It's a weapon of heroes that was built to battle the shadow - wielded by few and forged by one. Its smith's soul may have faded, but his legacy is yours to carry on, so long as you can claim it.

However, I have made one slight alteration. When it was first conceived, it took four sets of hands to wield this weapon properly. Now a single pilot can use it with ease - one warrior controlling the power of four souls.

Look for my sign, and I can give you the keys to its construction. Yet take care in gathering them. The shadows can sense my influence upon them, and that will draw peril to their side, as it always has. So fight as heroes did, and should you succeed, their strength will be yours. Theirs, yours and mine. Together. As one.",

Most on this island are consumed by the present – their immediate needs and struggles. Yet a new generation will live within our walls one day.

Unfortunately, he keeps following us even when we change course, like he's got our scent. He's still a day or two behind us, but eventually he'll catch up. When he does, we need to have an escape plan, because barring a serious upgrade in firepower...wait. Maybe we have that after all...",

Yongki looked past me, muttering about how he'd just quit.

Which it turned out was only about half a second longer-as long as it took for his vest to blast us into superheated plasma.

But now all those chunks of us are reversing direction and reintegrating, so Uma can lean in and try to hear Yongki's last words.

And now we're flying apart again, passing through her like she isn't there, because of course she wasn't in my office when this actually happened.

Like the island, this desert is a space station posing as a natural environment. It is inhabited by a large population of dangerous, genetically engineered creatures, and a small population of humans that are struggling to survive. This whole environment is then deliberately contained by a combination of a holographic horizon and natural barriers.

Assuming the other space stations are at all similar, then this whole thing is starting to look like some kind of bizarre experiment on a grand scale. Yes, each station would represent an experimental group, and...

Know that I choose to remember you not as the monster you were in your final moments, nor as the secretive, obsessive man you became after I found you in the desert. I should have seen the signs then. If I had, perhaps I wouldn't have to mark this empty grave.
This grave is for the man you were, and the man I will remember. He was the man who I'd talk and laugh with over tea long into the night, and the man who'd offer me supplies and a steed without a second thought. He was a scientist, a scholar and gentlemen. Wherever that man is, I hope he is at peace.
Your friend always,

It was a happy accident, borne of desperation. Death, that inescapable hunter, closed in on its lonely prey and I couldn't bear the sight. I tried to pry its jaws open, but I had no hands. So blindly, I thrashed and cried for help until I stumbled upon her, one who could be those hands. One who could give that person more than I ever could.

Once they have reached maximum taming affinity, they will be successfully tamed. To knock a creature unconscious, it will need to gain a significant amount of torpor from combat. The most common tools survivors use to knock a creature unconscious are; Slingshots, Tranquilizer Arrows, Tranquilizer Darts, Clubs, or even their Fists. To keep a creature knocked out, you will want to feed it Narcoberries or Narcotics, applying damage will also work but this will affect the taming effectiveness, which is how powerful the creature will be when tamed. Creatures lose effectiveness from taking longer to tame, as well as damage they have taken when unconscious.",

Diet: Carnivore

Wild
Like most Trilobites, Trilobite conchadurus is an opportunistic carnivore that feeds on anything smaller than itself which it can get a hold of. A sluggish creature, the Trilobite's best defense is its incredibly hard shell. This seems to be a common adaptation for the slower creatures of the Island.

Trilobite is not a very good source of food. The creature seems to be made mostly out of internal organs and its protective carapace. This is good for the trilobite, as both river and ocean predators are less likely to prey on it if there are better options around.

Domesticated
The Trilobite does not seem to have enough intelligence to be tamed. This doesn't mean it has no use among resourceful survivors, however. Found along beaches and in the ocean's shallows, Trilobites are easily one of the best sources of oil, pearl and chitin on the Island, presuming one doesn't wish to venture into the dangerous caves.",

Content/1657249736,"Uma actually seemed glad to see me back in my office again this morning.

She asked if I'd give her a full situation report on our biome decisions over dinner, and I was only too happy to cut out early for a fancy meal.

Figured I'd earned that much, breaking up all those arguments over nematode diversity.

Uma even grinned when I shared my pain over ancho-rubbed ribeyes and merlot.

Hadn't even been sure one of them could smile, so that felt like a win.

I spotted Yongki drinking by himself at the bar, and called him over to ask if they'd solved their perceptual foregrounding problem.

The kid seemed jittery around us. He's been working with transhumans longer than me, so what was that about?

Couldn't tell if Uma didn't notice him squirming, was too polite to say anything about it, or didn't care either way.

You know what?

Better follow up on this.",
Content/2599495288,"Uma reintegrates me one last time in the simulation of my ruined office, so she can ask what Yongki’s last words were to me and finish her post mortem.

I think I feel sorry to disappoint her...

There wasn't time for my neural interface to record whatever the kid said.

I throw the question back at her, and ask what he said when he resigned.

Uma says Yongki hated that he couldn't stop her kind from resurrecting his family in some strange future-a future that wasn't theirs.

There's no recognizable human emotion on her avatar's face, but maybe that's just a glitch in my emulated perception.

Then Uma surprises me by apologizing-for keeping secrets, and for failing to keep me safe.

She thanks me for all the work I've done for Genesis, and wishes future versions of me better luck when and wherever they wake up.

I tell her, ""Don't worry about me-I'm a survivor.""

That actually gets a smile out of her.

I try to hold onto this feeling as she shuts me down.",
Content/446651893,"Uma's been after me to choose some team leads, so I've been scanning her shortlist for standouts.

Alesya's thesis work, ""Environmental Transport of Energetic Compounds,"" jumped out at me...

It keeps me up at night knowing I designed munitions that permanently poisoned battlefields, so I'd love to promote someone into central planning who understands how to keep that Element junk from polluting our biomes.

Her high-level military clearance with the Terran Federation doesn't hurt either.

I'd feel better with that whiz kid Yongki running our engram reconstruction project, too.

He's a humanist zealot, so I think it's safe to assume his genius is all-natural and not from enhancement.

Nothing against Uma or the rest of them, but I'd rather have a regular human building our brain bank.

Yeah...better hold this upload. In fact, keep my journal local-only going forward, unless I say it's okay to commit any new entries.",

So if this key, such as it is, was acquired by activating one obelisk, then it follows that the other two keys can be obtained by activating the other two obelisks. Then, with all three keys, maybe this platform will lead to whatever is controlling the Island's ecosystem. 

If the other obelisks work the way that the first one did, that means I need to find a whole mess of artifacts first, and I don't think I can do that alone...",
Content/1559827394,"Unbelievable. Have these idol worshipping ninnies replaced all their common sense with blind devotion? Have years of oppressive heat completely addled their brains?

I was finally allowed to see the monastery's inner sanctum, and lo and behold, there they were. Sitting upon an altar before a flock of protesting primitives were these glowing artifacts, just like the ones I had found in the caverns beneath the island. Yet instead of making use of them or even studying them, these halfwits are praying to them!

The true value of those artifacts is completely lost on these simpletons. Sacred relics, indeed!",

In it, I saw violet fingers clawing at bedrock, knuckle deep in soil. They reached further, stretching, splitting and spreading like a web as stone crumbled beneath them, until at last they found a molten heart, its cadence soft and steady. Without pity, they grasped it in their twisting tendrils and squeezed. The heart's rhythm slowed, then stopped altogether, and at last it turned to cold, lifeless stone.

As the heart died, strings of shadow shot from the violet fingers. I traced the them across cracked and drying flesh, and when the strands ended I saw it - an army of monstrous shadows, hunting for even the smallest glimmer of light. And they were marching right towards me.",

Content/2903635381,"Wali has been much quieter since we found Rockwell. I guess she's just letting us catch up. However, she did say something interesting when we were recounting Nerva's ambitions for the Island.

""This place would never allow anyone to master it,"" she said, and when I asked her to explain, she told me that the great city to the southeast was destroyed by the obelisk itself. 

Now it's just conjecture, but it's interesting to think about. Could the curators of these stations be monitoring human behavior and clipping its wings should the survivors ever band together and fly too close to the sun? If each station represents a different group in a larger experiment, ""resetting"" human progress would make a lot of sense. 

It's a bit grim though, isn't it? Yikes.",

Content/1929643991,"Walker had told us to expect some kind of monster after activating the obelisk, but I never imagined that we would battle one of Ceres' dragons. No, that's not right. It was too colossal and wild for even a god's chariot. I doubt Diana herself could control it, and yet, the New Legion felled it.

It cost the lives of many men and even more beasts, but it was worth the sacrifice. According to Walker, the third key we acquired may allow me to open this cave she speaks of. Then the power of the obelisks and this very island will be mine to command.

Content/1788361319,"We contacted the village to tell them we succeeded. They were a lot more excited than we were. It was quite raucous actually - cheering, applause, and all that - enough that Santiago almost dropped the radio right out of his hands.
Even Mei Yin cracked a smile at that. She's coming around, if slowly. She just needed a bit of space, I think.
I'm starting to come to terms with everything myself. Even if my memories are someone else's or aren't real to begin with, what I've done since I arrived on these stations was my choice. What I do from now on is my choice. That's who Helena Walker is.
I think I'm okay with that.",
Content/92396601,We crucify ourselves between two thieves,
Content/3902785925,"We finally found it! This has to be the obelisk's control room. Fortunately, the consoles here were similar to the ones in the control center that I've used before, so I was able to help Santiago get started.
He's been working on it for a while now, muttering and cursing to himself the whole time. I can't blame him. This is some baffling shit we've... ha! No way! He just said he cracked it! It certainly sounded like he did, too. There was a loud hum and... 

Oh. Those are roars. Lots of roars. Time to run, then! I'll finish this later.",
Content/695813528,"We finally managed to get a terminal working, and well, this is it. I almost can't believe it, but I've finally found it! The mystery behind those stations, the whole reason we even exist, it's all right here!

According to this, those space stations are deliberately designed bio-domes called ""ARKs,"" and they're exactly what they sound like: lifeboats. Whatever happened to the Earth, whether it was Element based technology like Santiago suspected or something else, these ARKs were built to preserve and cultivate life in all forms - fauna, flora and of course, human - safely separated from the planet's poisoned surface.

But something's gone wrong. There's all sorts of errors here...maybe that's why they turned into such death traps. There's something about a ""Reseed Protocol"" too.

I'll need time to look this over.",
Content/4086522092,"We finally tracked down our culprit this morning, and damn was he one big, mean son of a gun. He had wings like a bat, a head like lizard and spat fire from his mouth. I've never seen anything like it, not even here. Fortunately, anything will die if you put enough bullets in its head. 

One of my men called it a wyvern, but he'd never actually seen one before. Said it was just a legend. No one in town had seen one either.

So where'd it come from? Did it just suddenly fly here from parts unknown? This whole affair doesn't sit right with me. Gives me a bad feeling.",
Content/3028117216,"We finished marking the last of the graves a few hours ago. It was hard to say goodbye, but having recently died myself, I know that sitting here and crying my eyes out for a week straight won't help them. Hopefully they find peace within that void, or something better beyond it.

Now it's just me, Mei-Yin and the long road ahead. Well, and the faceless presence that's guiding us down that road of course. I've already started to feel the tugs pulling me towards Arat Prime.

Not sure what's waiting for us there, but with Mei by my side and a dangerous mission in front of us, I'm just going to relax and enjoy the ride. I can admit that I'm certifiable for saying so, but this kind of life? It's just my speed.",
Content/3180025460,"We got another call from the village, but this one wasn't celebratory. In fact, best we can tell, it was a distress call. Santiago couldn't quite clear up the signal, but it had that sort of tone. We heard Diana's voice, panicked shouts, and someone mentioned Rockwell.
Since then we've picked up the pace. Hopefully we can make it back in time to help, and the situation isn't as dangerous as it sounded. If something were to happen to Rockwell, I can't help but feel like it would be my fault for neglecting him.
Damn it all. We've got to hurry!",
Content/260212405,"We have arrived at the structure Helena wanted to investigate, and I fear if we do not enter soon that she will faint from anticipation. She has been hopping to and fro like a rabbit while we set up camp, babbling excitedly about what might be inside.

I have never shared her curiosity for such mysteries. Things are the way they are, the why of it does not matter. Unless it will help us survive, then I do not care who built the empty palaces of this land or what their purpose was.

However, I trust Helena's wisdom. Hopefully whatever we find here will sate her, and perhaps grant me a moment of blissful silence at that.",
Content/1005671374,We must turn our attention to Earth.,
Content/1582138893,"We received a hero's welcome when we limped back to the village. The others say that Juzi's treasure will help complete a magic door that can take us out of this place. They speak of escape and of returning home. 
That should excite me more. I used to long for those things, yet what comforts me most is that when they speak of their future, they include me in it. I am finally one of them, not as a mercenary or out of desperation, but because I am wanted.
I owe it to Juzi, I think. No, to Diana. She trusted me before anyone else. I will not forget that.",
Content/2588787539,"We shared our findings with the village by radio. Santiago's analysis confirmed what I suspected - the obelisks are highly unstable. They could be days away from reacting.

However, Santiago raised a good point. Even if the gateway project is shut down, we can't say for sure that it would stabilize the obelisks. It may be too late to dissuade the station from destroying the village. The only way to ensure our survival is to shut down the obelisks themselves.

According to Santiago, we can't do that from the obelisk's platforms, but he may be able to manipulate said platforms into teleporting us somewhere we could. Specifically? Into the heart of the station itself.

It's a huge risk, but it may be the only hope we have.",
Content/2489823243,"We sized each other up for a while before my new friend popped his helmet off to frown at me.

He wanted to know why a 'kid like me' was risking my neck for him.

Even though I was sick with relief to see another human face, his tone set me off.

I reminded him that I was the one who led him to safety.

He apologized for being short with me, and offered to shake hands.

I took his hand, hoping he wouldn't crush mine with that gauntlet he was still wearing.

We introduced ourselves—he said his name was Gabriel.

For the first time, I was glad for the training we'd had in colonist reintegration.

I could fall back on those conversational prompts, and remember to offer Gabriel food and drink from our stores.

And it felt good to play host.",
Content/658450054,"We ventured above ground to look for styders, and spotted two right away, roaming toward an outcropping of rocks.
It was a long hike to reach them, and Nida insisted on doing it by night.
For the first time, it occurred to me to wonder how there could even be day and night on these wheels.
Did her people take the sun with them, when they flew off into the stars?
Before we'd come topside, Nida showed me how to use her magic gear to look around in the dark.
It was distracting - I'd keep stopping to gawk at things I shouldn’t be able to see at all.
I took the lead since I was the one in armor, but the girl managed to keep pace with me.
We caught up with the stryders while they were standing snout-to-snout, as if they were conversing somehow.
They were so massive, it took my breath away to be close to them.
Now I just had to trust that the girl knew how to tame those mechanical hulks.",
Content/3120840326,"We weren't kept completely in the dark about our estranged transhuman cousins, but I think there's been a concerted generational effort to repress those memories.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid we'd see some appeal in the idea of accelerating our own evolution if we learned more about Homo deus.

If so, that seems silly, because there are kiloparsecs between us and the refined xenomaterial they needed to do it.

Historical archives say the Element War was fought over divergent ideas about how to deal with our polluted biosphere and dwindling resources.

Our ancestors in the Terran Federation thought they'd finally found a clean source of power for their grand geoengineering schemes to hack and repair the planet.

The United Republics of Earth wanted to hack themselves using that same power, and survive by becoming more than human.

Neither side was right.",
Content/35415528,"We're losing people trying to stop whatever it is that's invading our ship.

I want to join the fight to retake the forward ring, but I keep getting told I'm needed back here, to maintain and monitor our remaining ecosystems for contamination.

I know the real reason they don't want me fighting is because in their eyes, I'm still just a kid.

But no one would even know we'd had an intruder if I hadn't discovered it.

I keep turning that over in my mind while I'm maintaining autosamplers or waiting for phase analysis results on soil biota: how and why would a transhuman's artificial intelligence disrupt our shipboard systems?

Would this entity really resent our mission enough to reach across thousands of lightyears and try to scuttle our ship?

That just seems unusually vindictive for one of them, especially after all this time.

I can't make this make sense.",
Content/2108017127,"We've all given the Genesis simulation's 'survive as long as you can while taming an unfamiliar and hostile environment' scenario a spin, if only to see what that's like for our colonist cargo.

One of my more popular sims turned Genesis inside out, with alien megafauna rampaging through a simulated version of our ship's biomes.

I never expected to experience something like that firsthand.

Aberrant, wild creatures are prowling the forward ring, and tearing anyone apart that dares to enter their territory.

This is no simulation.

Out here in the real world, my crewmates aren't ever going to respawn.

I've never felt fear like this before.

At least the adrenaline is keeping me hard at work even though I'm beyond exhausted.

I've been able to confirm that the biomes in our ring haven't been contaminated yet, so that's something.",
Content/474467778,"We've been tracking these damn things for ages. I can't believe they travelled so far just to attack us. Something like that has to be deliberate. I already knew these things were smart, but if they're that determined to kill us, then we've got to wipe them out here and now.

A horrifying scene awaited us. All of Nerva's men and a large, bizarre creature lay dead in a heap, but Nerva's body was missing. Forgetting my present company, I suggested a peaceful approach if we encountered him. That earned me one hell of a knockout punch.

Yet what I did find was fascinating. It was quickly evident that I was on some kind of space station, but when I looked out one window in particular, I realized something even more surprising – I'd been on a space station the whole time.
 
There, floating outside the window and surrounded by machinery, was the very island that I had been living on, and it too was orbiting high above the surface of some unknown planet. The ecosystem on the Island wasn't just curated, it was completely artificial from the ground up!

Yet I've found nothing to indicate that any population shift is actually happening.

First he told me he'd heard a rumor that I'd been killed near the end of the war.

Then he admitted to trying to access my personnel file for proof of life, only to find himself locked out.

Even though he'd admitted to crossing a serious line, I laughed it off and pointed out I was sitting right there next to him.

Content/1310129354,"While a prudent general must take his time to plan, I realize that comfort breeds complacence. So as my scouts range across the beaches and jungles, I have made sure to lead our main force out on regular raids. Our targets have been weak – mostly small villages or unsuspecting convoys – but they resist enough to keep my men's instincts sharp. Letting them keep the meager spoils of these exercises has helped morale as well.

Our actions have not gone unnoticed, however. My scouts say many tribes are avoiding our territory altogether now. Good. A fearsome reputation will serve the Legion well.

Many of this cavern's species are bioluminescent, so out of curiosity, I dissected several of the glowing insects that are common here. After further study, I have concluded that the luminescent fluid found in their posteriors carries something akin to a bioelectric charge. However I cannot determine how it is generated, and with no place to store it, said charge fades quickly.
Curious, curious indeed! What could be to cause of this? With no sunlight to provide the forest with energy, perhaps this charge comes from the soil?",

Of course raw Element was going to be raised from the surface, along with veins of every other metal.

There's no existing technology to remove xenotoxins from that volume of material, at least not in the timeframe we're dealing with.

That got me thinking about using meks to clean up our biomes over the long haul.

We really had no idea how long it was going to take for our colony ship to find a habitable world-it could end up jumping around the galaxy for millennia.

Decontamination would be a huge job, calling for herds of machines roaming the ship's interior.

I know how to run samples of the invasive flora and fauna from the contaminated ring through our array of analytical equipment, but when it comes to interpreting the results I'm mostly at a loss.

Anyone could see that these invaders are wildly exotic and demonstrably hostile, but beyond that, I'd just be guessing at what I'm looking at.

That said, I'm relatively sure that a lot of what I sampled were genetically-modified organisms-like our maewings-possibly created using commandeered equipment in the other ring.

Unlike maewings, all of these organisms seem to have been created to establish an aggressive perimeter defense.

Defense of what, I'm not exactly sure...

I'm back to suspecting our Homo deus visitor is responsible, but I haven't even mentioned the most damning evidence-I think I'm seeing traces of Element in these samples, the same alien material that poisoned our home planet.

Content/1273502317,"Yes, I understand now! All of this is by design. This place, these creatures, our arrival...he orchestrated it all as a test. This artifact isn't the prize, it is simply a token, proof that I am worthy! It is the key that will unlock the path below, and at its end I will find the king. There I will find the Master.

Although if this is the key, then where is the door? That terminal we passed by earlier? Yes, that must be it. I need only convince the others to head in that direction, and then... 

It is as I said before, sacrifices must be made. That is the way of things. That is the way of the Master.",

Content/1466703152,"Yes, yes of course! The Edmundium is the cause! If there are truly molten pools of Edmundium somewhere in these caverns, then Edmundium minerals would have spread throughout the soil over time, allowing its wondrous properties to affect nearby flora and fauna.
Even if it is not the direct source of the charge found in this forest's bioluminescent wildlife, it may have incited incremental changes in those species over several generations, which then led to their development of an internal charge. 

How invigorating! I could be standing in the middle of an entire ecosystem that has been absorbing the effects of Edmundium for generations, and all of its secrets are mine for the taking. Magnificent!",
Content/509740005,"Yesterday, I realized that I could rest no longer. I had no more spare cloth for bandages and had eaten nearly all the moss nearby. Rather than risk the heat of the sun on the surface, I ventured deeper into the caverns.
It was a treacherous descent, but I am glad I went. This cave is larger than I could have imagined. In fact, it is hardly a cave at all. A great forest flourishes down here. It is as if this whole land is backwards.
However, there is one thing that is familiar to me. The air is thick with the sound and smell of wild beasts. I must remain on my guard.",
Content/4065043594,"Yesterday, I stalked a giant shelled beast, with large claws that it could use like hands. Though slow, it seemed strong. I decided it would be a good addition to my army, but before I could attempt to bring it down, something swooped down from the sky to attack it.
It was a great lizard, but not one like the ones I had seen before. No, this beast was a true dragon, long of body with a feathery mane. It used the feathers on its arms to ride the wind and tore its prey's shell asunder with iron claws. When it was finished with its meal, it scaled the cavern wall and became one with the shadows, vanishing entirely from my sight.
I have found my new prey. Soon, I shall command the might of a dragon.",

Content/299955076,"Yongki kept on acting weird all day.

Once I caught on that he was ducking me, I tried to put myself in places where we'd have to cross paths.

When we did, he kept conversations so professional that it felt like he was messing with me.

Whiz kids like him can be twitchy...

I thought maybe I just couldn't read him, any more than I can guess what kind of complicated data crunching Uma's doing at any given time.

So I opted for the direct approach-said he'd hurt my feelings, and just when I thought we'd had a good vibe going.

That got him to laugh and loosen up a bit, so I offered to buy him a round at the canteen and build on that.

A few pints later, I had him sharing pics of his husband and kids.

Never would've figured a young guy like Yongki for a family man.

I thought about the all-nighters he'd been putting in, and pulled rank to order him home for a few days.",
Content/2088530361,"Yongki offered to resign over the mangled engram I found in his archive yesterday, but instead I ordered him to knock off early and come drink with me in the canteen.

I don't like that the kid's my only sounding board for my paranoia, but he gave me these doubts to begin with!

He's also the only one qualified to tell me if what I'm afraid of is even possible.

I knew his team already had a zillion engrams in their brain bank, including my own.

I made my joining the project conditional on their agreement not to emulate and archive me for resurrection.

Clearly they had that capacity anyway, over my objections.

What if that rumor Yongki heard was true, that I'd died near the end of the war?

Was it so crazy to imagine that the transhumans just booted up another copy of me, after editing my memories to fill the gap?

Could I be Santigo 2.0?",

GraphLiteral/1603032011,Comments,
GraphLiteral/3663497630,Common,
GraphLiteral/3608260884,"Common name:
Tapejara
Species: Tapejara imperator
Time: Cretaceous
Diet: Carnivorous
Temperament: Skittish

Wild
Tapejara imperator is a marvel to watch in the wild. It has astonishing agility compared to the Island's other flyers thanks in large part to the rudder-like fin that extends from its snout to the back of its skull.

Initially, I'd thought the fin was simply composed of keratin, but closer inspection has led me to believe that it is actually some kind of sensory organ. Not only does it decrease Tapejara's turning radius even at high speeds, but it apparently provides Tapejara with extra information to help it fly through the air with unparalleled grace. I've even seen Tapejara hover and strafe side-to-side in the air without moving forward at all. It's quite remarkable. The creature also makes effective use of razor-sharp claws to latch onto surfaces such as the trunks of tall trees, holding its position indefinitely.

Domesticated
Warlike tribes appear to consider Tapejara the equivalent of a versatile rotor aircraft, capable of rapid positional changes and aggressive agility.

When domesticated the Tapejara is typically outfitted with a unique triple-rider saddle, enabling two passengers to wield handheld weaponry while the pilot takes the reins. When the Tapejara is latched onto a surface, both the passengers and pilot are able to make full use of their weapons together!

Evidently what this skittering creature lacks in distance-stamina, constitution, and weight carrying capacity, it makes up for in maneuverability and combat versatility.",

GraphLiteral/3116941109,"Species: Rhyniognatha antiquagenitorTime: Early DevonianDiet: OmnivoreTemperament: AggressiveWildI swear, every new creature I come across here makes me more sure they’ve all had their genes tampered with. I know I'm right about this! Take this monster bug I’m calling 'Rhyniognatha antiquagenitor' -- big enough to headline a horror flick, but still light enough to fly and skate across water.Would you believe it also makes a weirdly useful, quick-hardening resin with a variety of uses? It can thicken up its shell for a defensive boost, spray hard bullet-like globs, or squirt soft globs that harden on impact to gum up incoming predators!DomesticatedThis overgrown earwig is just what you need to level up your tribe’s aerial defenses. It can stick itself to creatures or cargo and carry things around your base, and its glue-bombs disrupt Tek just as well as Dinopithecus dung!That said, Rhyniognatha-raising isn't for the squeamish... Their males have a pheromone that invites egg-laying females to use them as hosts. Harvest that pheromone, and you can mark any creature for the female to lay her eggs on. The host then incubates a new generation of larvae that can reap its best traits in the process.If some poor beast gets eggs laid on it by accident, you might still be able to save it by popping it in a cryopod and freezing out the larvae.",
